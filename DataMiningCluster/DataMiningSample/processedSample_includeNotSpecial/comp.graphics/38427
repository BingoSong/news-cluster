sphere
from
points
another
method
first
find
center
circle
defined
sets
points
intersecting
normals
from
would
also
define
circle
center
however
small
numerical
imprecisions
would
make
lines
intersect
supposedly
planes
have
intersect
unique
point
parallel
having
thought
about
why
don
you
project
lines
onto
d
plane
formed
lines
do
intersection
calculation
plane
d
where
you
re
guaranteed
unique
solution
unless
re
parallel
which
won
happen
case
use
parametric
distance
along
lines
from
circle
centres
determine
exact
point
interest
bypasses
messy
error
propogation
required
do
calculation
d
hope
i
haven
put
my
foot
again
