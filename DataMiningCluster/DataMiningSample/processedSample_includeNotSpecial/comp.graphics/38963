moved
bit
i
wrote
something
about
making
color
modifications
quickly
bit
quantized
images
only
saving
image
file
process
we
have
make
modifications
bit
image
makes
sense
because
main
use
xv
only
viewing
images
doing
many
changes
image
we
should
keep
all
modifications
buffer
before
making
operations
bit
image
we
should
simplify
operation
list
unnecessary
operations
think
about
what
you
saying
here
bit
image
quantised
down
bits
so
many
similar
colours
mapped
onto
single
palette
colour
colour
gets
modified
fairly
arbitrary
ways
you
want
apply
modifications
back
bit
file
so
you
have
find
which
colours
mapped
one
palette
colour
ok
you
could
do
copying
bit
file
bit
file
using
extra
bits
hold
index
entry
having
done
you
need
do
something
them
what
exactly
apply
difference
rgb
between
original
modified
palette
entry
each
colour
group
could
generate
colours
rgb
outside
range
would
also
lead
discontinuities
when
different
parts
smooth
colour
gradient
mapped
several
different
palette
entries
you
could
interpolate
from
full
modification
modification
depending
how
far
each
colour
from
palette
entry
however
i
suspect
would
look
rather
odd
so
summary
what
i
said
my
previous
posting
still
holds
how
would
you
suggest
doing
colour
editing
bit
file
how
would
you
group
related
colours
edit
them
together
only
global
changes
could
done
unless
software
were
very
different
much
more
complicated
you
want
do
colour
editing
bit
image
you
need
much
more
powerfull
software
which
readily
available
commercially
other
words
edit
bit
file
you
need
software
built
job
tacking
mods
onto
xv
going
create
more
problems
than
solves
other
bits
you
seemed
claiming
were
bugs
xv
what
you
meant
you
propably
misunderstood
what
i
wrote
you
have
done
many
places
so
far
yes
i
probably
did
i
found
collected
digest
format
your
posting
made
little
difficult
understand
precisely
what
your
point
sorry
i
misunderstood
you
also
missed
what
were
wrong
xv
however
i
did
wrote
yes
again
what
wrong
xv
