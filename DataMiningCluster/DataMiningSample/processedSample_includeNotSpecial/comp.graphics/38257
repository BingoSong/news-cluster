hello
real
reality
our
agency
started
express
interest
virtual
reality
vr
so
far
we
do
know
much
about
vr
all
we
know
about
hollywood
movies
terminater
lawnmover
man
we
also
know
something
about
vr
from
abc
news
magazine
computer
graphics
world
magazine
unfortunately
while
sgi
systems
were
used
create
special
effects
both
terminator

man
those
film
quality
computer
graphics
rendered
software
written
film
frame
time
each
frame
computer
animation
those
films
took
hours
render
high
end
parallel
processing
computer
systems
thus
level
graphics
would
difficult
impossible
acheive
real
time
frames
per
second
we
certainly
want
know
more
about
vr
who
leading
companies
agencies
universities
what
machines
support
vr
i
e
sgi
sun
hp
bim
etc
depends
upon
how
serious
you
how
advanced
your
application
true
immersive
visualization
vr
requires
rendering
complex
visual
databases
anywhere
from
newly
rendered
frames
per
second
similar
requirement
traditional
flight
simulators
pilot
training
frame
rate
too
low
user
notices
stepping
frames
move
head
rapidly
around
scene
so
motion
graphics
smooth
contiguous
thus
graphics
system
must
powerful
enough
sustain
high
frame
rates
while
rendering
complex
data
representations
additionally
frame
rate
must
constant
system
renders

one

simpler

rather

silicon
graphics
has
modified
unix
kernel
its
multi

systems
able
support
real

operation
bypassing
usual
unix
process
priority
management

uniprocessor
systems
running
unix
cannot
fundamentally
support

sun

even

systems
support
real

operation
due
symmetric

smp
shared

architecture
from

perspective
rendering
complex
virtual

requires
advanced
rendering
techniques
like

all

market
today
only
crimson

particularly
important
crawling

you
