quicktime
performance
re
rumours
about
do
ok
all
discussion
about
observed
playback
speeds
quicktime
effects
scaling
so
i
thought
i
d
do
some
more
tests
first
all
i
felt
my
original
speed
test
perhaps
less
than
realistic
movie
i
had
been
using
only
had
frames
version
very
first
movie
i
created
compact
video
compressor
i
decided
something
little
longer
would
give
closer
real
world
results
better
worse
i
pulled
out
copy
space
odyssey
i
had
recorded
off
tv
while
back
about
fifteen
minutes
movie
sequence
where
earth
shuttle
approaching
space
station
specifically
i
digitized
portion
about
seconds
duration
zooming
rotating
space
station
i
figured
would
give
reasonable
amount
movement
between
frames
increase
differences
between
frames
i
digitized
only
frames
per
second
give
total
frames
i
captured
raw
footage
resolution
pixels
spigot
card
my
centris
quarter
size
resolution
from
pal
source
i
imported
premiere
put
through
compact
video
compressor
keeping
fps
frame
rate
i
created
two
versions
movie
one
scaled
resolution
other
resolution
i
used
default
quality
setting
premiere
specified
key
frame
every
ten
frames
i
ran
movie
through
same
raw
speed
test
program
i
used
results
i
d
been
reporting
earlier
result
playback
rate
over
frames
per
second
right
i
getting
much
higher
result
than
first
short
test
movie
just
fun
i
copied
movie
my
external
hard
disk
quantum
lp
ran
from
time
playback
rate
only
about
frames
per
second
obviously
mb
internal
hard
disk
also
quantum
significant
contributor
speed
playback
i
modified
my
speed
test
program
allow
specification
optional
scaling
factors
tried
playing
back
movie
scaled
size
time
playback
speed
over
fps
clearly
poster
who
observed
poor
performance
scaled
playback
seeing
quicktime
action
i
d
try
my
tests
quicktime
i
don
think
entirely
compatible
my
centris
system
unscaled
playback
rate
movie
over
fps
other
thing
i
tried
saving
versions
movie
preferred
playback
rates
greater
than
seeing
how
well
played
from
within
movieplayer
ie
quicktime
normal
synchronized
playback
preferred
rate
fps
didn
work
too
well
playback
very
jerky
compare
raw
speed
test
which
achieved
fps
ease
i
can
believe
quicktime
synchronization
code
would
add
much
overhead
i
think
slowdown
coming
from
mac
system
task
switching
preferred
rate
fps
seemed
work
fine
i
couldn
see
any
evidence
stutter
fps
i
think
i
could
see
slight
stutter
four
key
frames
every
second
hard
tell
i
guess
i
could
try
recreating
movies
longer
interval
between
key
frames
make
stutter
more
noticeable
course
also
improve
compression
slightly
which
should
speed
up
playback
performance
even
more
