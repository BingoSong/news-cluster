re
sphere
from
points
i
plan
post
summary
responses
soon
i
have
working
code
which
i
also
include
intersection
planes
method
looks
best
my
implementation
based
short
article
graphics
gems
i
doesn
work
i
may
misinterpreting
course
i
had
avoided
simultaneous
solution
plane
equations
favor
dot
cross
products
former
may
actually
better
either
case
matrix
determinant
needs
computed
implicitly
solution
linear
equations
get
planes
i
taking
midpoint
line
from
say
p
p
setting
normal
normalized
vector
from
p
p
just
plugged
formula
graphics
gems
however
resulting
center
point
only
occasionally
equidistant
from
all
my
test
points
different
tests
my
matrix
vector
math
very
rusty
looks
like
i
need
verify
formula
use
simultaneous
equation
solution
which
require
bringing
another
routine
i
don
have
should
easy
find
another
method
first
find
center
circle
defined
sets
points
intersecting
normals
from
would
also
define
circle
center
however
small
numerical
imprecisions
would
make
lines
intersect
supposedly
planes
have
intersect
unique
point
parallel
