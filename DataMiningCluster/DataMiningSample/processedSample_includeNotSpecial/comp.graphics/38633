your

app
i
certainly
do
use
whenever
i
have
do
tiff
usually
works
very
well
my
point
i
m
philosophically
opposed
because
its
complexity
complexity
has
led
some
programs
poor
tiff
writers
making
some
very
bizarre
files
other
programs
inability
load
tiff
images
though
ll
save
them

inability
interchange
images
between
different
environments

success
tiff
designed
powerful
flexible
expense
simplicity

all
options
currently

application
does
complete
job
currently
only
way
you
can
sure
you
able
import
any

image
since
so
many
image
generating
applications
out
now
