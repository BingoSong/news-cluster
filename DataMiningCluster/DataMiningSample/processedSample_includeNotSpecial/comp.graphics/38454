removing
distortion
from
bitmapped
drawings
let
say
you
have
scanned
image
line
drawing
case
boat
could
anything
drawing
you
have
set
reference
points
whose
true
x
y
positions
known
now
you
digitize
drawing
manually
case
using
yaron
danon
excellent
digitize
program
you
use
program
which
converts
cursor
positions
x
y
saves
those
values
when
you
click
mouse
upon
digitizing
you
notice
reference
point
values
come
out
digitizing
process
differ
small
significant
ways
from
known
true
values
understandable
because
scanned
drawing
reproduction
original
successive
sources
distortion
differential
expansion
contraction
paper
errors
introduced
printing
process
scanner
errors
what
have
you
errors
uniform
over
entire
drawing
so
global
adjustments
stretching
contracting
uniformly
over
x
y
rotating
whole
drawing
satisfactory
so
question
does
any
kind
soul
know
algorithm
removing
distortion
particular
i
have
three
sets
points
reference
x
y
known
true
values
distortedreference
x
y
same
points
known
errors
distorteddata
x
y
other
points
unknown
errors
what
function
reference
distorted
could
i
apply
distorteddata
remove
errors
i
suspect
problem
could
solved
treating
distorted
reference
points
resulting
from
projection
bumpy
d
surface
solving
surface
flattening
remove
errors
other
data
points
any
kind
informed
soul
out
have
any
ideas
better
yet
pointers
treatments
same
similar
problems
thanks
earl
