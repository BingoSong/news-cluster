how
would
you
suggest
doing
colour
editing
bit
file
how
would
you
group
related
colours
edit
them
together
only
global
changes
could
done
unless
software
were
very
different
much
more
complicated
you
want
do
colour
editing
bit
image
you
need
much
more
powerfull
software
which
readily
available
commercially
i
guess
i
edited
my
note
away
from
article
i
posted
many
newsgroups
i
wrote
something
about
making
color
modifications
quickly
bit
quantized
images
only
saving
image
file
process
we
have
make
modifications
bit
image
makes
sense
because
main
use
xv
only
viewing
images
doing
many
changes
image
we
should
keep
all
modifications
buffer
before
making
operations
bit
image
we
should
simplify
operation
list
unnecessary
operations
lastly
jpeg
compression
algorithm
can
applied
any
image
arbitrary
bit
depth
again
bug
never
claimed
bug
i
tried
kept
sure
i
don
claim
jpeg
noting
else
than
compression
algorithm
because
i
know
what
jpeg
you
propably
misunderstood
what
i
wrote
you
have
done
many
places
so
far
you
also
missed
what
were
wrong
xv

i
did
