complexity
anyone
who
thinks
tiff
too
complex
hasn
dealt
cgm
asn
cda

any
one
number
other
very
successful
file
format
people
seem
perfectly
capable
dealing

dealing
format
tiff
frankly
less
difficult
than
dealing
dct
lzw
fax
encoding
image
data
majority
libraries
which
deal
tiff
dedicated
other
issues
rather
than
simply
decoding
tags
parameters
perhaps
people
overwhelmed
comparison
some
rather
simpleminded
formats
gif
pcx
bmp
suggest
tiff
so
complex
doomed
failure
ludicrous
doesn
mean
gif
isn
fine
don
even
thing
about
using
many
instances
gif
very
nice
use
low
end
photos

slow
low
end
advantage
tiff
brings
table
its
ability
handle
all
situations
some
naturally
more
complex
i
ld
rather
propose
tiff
imaging
solutions
over

systems
based
having
deal
file

anyday
you
may
find
tiff
too
complicated
your
personal
tastes
please
don
wrail
against

doesn
come
