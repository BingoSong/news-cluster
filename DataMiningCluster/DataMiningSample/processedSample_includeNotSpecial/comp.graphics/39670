moving

realtime
hdtv
has
about
mb
frame
so
recording
playing
moving

need
about
mb

bandwidth
i
m
thinking
treat
raw
data
compressed
actually
digital
hdtv
systems
far
higher
bandwidth
than
you
need
unless
some
reason
you
must
work
fully
uncompressed
hdtv
also
my
calculations
each
frame
should
well
under
mb
even
using

which
more

advise
trying

you
don
