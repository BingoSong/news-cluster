while
entirely

unpredictable
also
true
fractals
so
one
could
also
conclude
you
could
model
fractally
yeah
also
true
most
long
complicated
sequences
events
calculations
big
computer
programs
general
i
don
argue
you
can
get
similar
maybe
useful
results
from
fractals
i
just
question
whether
you
should
fractal
fiends
seem
saying
any
part
system
we
can
model
should
replaced
random
number
generator
has

system
i
don
think
has
much
do
fractals
i
certainly
would
rather
model
improved
more
explicable
manner
i
guess
i
just
haven
seen
all
earth
shaking
fractal
models
explain
correlate
universe
actually
exists
i
really
hope
i
do

good
fractal
image
compression
uh
huh
i
ll
believe
when
i
see
i
ve
been
chasing
fractal
compression
few
years
i
still
don
believe
so
great
how
come
we
don
see
competing
jpeg
cause
can
i
ll
wager
actually
i
have
wagered
i
quit
trying
make
fractal
compression
work
i
trying
because
i
don
think
reasonable
alternative
other
techniques
neat
though
i
ll
reiterate
my
disbelief
everything
fractal
why
i
don
think
fractal
compression
widely
explained
practical
i
know
barnsley
sloan
have
some
tricks
up
sleeves
make
demos
work
i
don
see
anyone

six

since
iterated

formed
right
always
going
