existence
i
assumed
rashly
particular
number
would
reserved
further

rather
than

ah
well
i
guess

what
i
am
going
say
i
have
little
bit
skeptic
about
performance
you
claiming
centris
you
ll
see
why
please
flames
i
reserve
those
c
m
i
chicago
last
consumer
electronics
show
apple
had
booth
i
walked
were
showing
real
time
video
capture
using
radious
supermac
card
digitize
make
right
spot
quicktime
movies
i
think
quicktime
were
using
old
one
version
quicktime
has
been
stated
current
version
software
older
version
horizon
too
distant
future
digitized
guy
talking
x
xx
something
played
back
quite
nicely
real
time
guy
expanded
window
resized
x
xx
y
i
think
frame
rate
decreased
enough
notice
wasn
fps
about
fps
anymore
dropped
like
fps
he
increased
just
bit
more
dropped
fps
quicktime
does
much
better
job
playing
back
movies
size
than
does
playing
back
resized
movies
apparently
process
expanding
each
frame
image
dithering
resultant
bitmap
appropriate
bit
depth
pretty
processor
intensive
optimizers
work
pretty
well
showing
movies
double
size
you
drop
x
size
increase
x
size
performance
suffers
dramatically
i
asked
him
what
mac
he
using
he
using
quadra
don
know
what
model
do
he
telling
guys
quicktime
could
play
back
same
speed
even
lcii
he
lied
quicktime
very
cpu
dependent
he
probably
confused
fact
qt
locked
internal
timecode
play
same
amount
time
any
machine
however
lc
drop
frames
order
keep
sound
video
synced
up
centris
quadras
have
similar
cpus
thus
boast
similar
performance
though
quadras
bit
faster
due
marginally
faster
clock
speeds
somewhat
different
architecture
well
i
spoiled
his
claim
so
say
since
quadra
mac
having
little
bit
trouble
wasn
even
from
hardisk
from
memory
could
you
saw
either
newer
version
quicktime
some
hardware
assisted
centris
another
software
product
running
animation
like
supposedly
macromind
accelerator
i
expect
version
quicktime
software
you
saw
i
using
one
new
codecs
v
allows
video
nearly
twice
size
same
frame
rate
what
version
could
handle
centris
i
saw
plain
vanilla
exception
nice
speakers
were
playing
sound
software
movie
player
qt
player
apple
includes
software
don
misunderstand
me
i
just
want
clarify
problem
still
surprises
me
quicktime
able
do
things
does
well
can
