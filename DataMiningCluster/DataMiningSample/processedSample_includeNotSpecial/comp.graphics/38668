thanks
all
who
replied
my
original
question
i
ve
implemented
ideas
from
article
above
i
m
very
satisfied
results
i
needed
my
bezier
curve
approximation
routine
some
cases
generating
offset
curves
loops
can
occur
i
now
have
fast
method
detecting
generation
curve
loop
although
i
did
follow
article
above
strictly
check
fourth
control
point
lies
loop
area
which
bounded
two
parabolas
one
ellips
too
complicated
instead
i
enlarged
loop
area
surrounded
straight
lines
check
now
simple
fast
my
approximation
routine
never
ever
outputs
self
intersecting
bezier
curves
again
