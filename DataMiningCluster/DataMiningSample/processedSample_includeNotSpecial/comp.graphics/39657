many
high
end
graphics
cards
come
c
source
code
doing
basic
graphics
sorts
things
change
colors
draw
points
lines
polygons
fills
etc
does
library
exist
generic
vga
graphics
cards
chips
hopefully
public
domain
would
purpose
compiling
under
non
dos
operating
system
running
standard

i
m
also
interested

commercial
graphics
library
package
do
pc
vga

i
m
currently
working
realtime
application
running
pcc
non
dos
kernel
needs
do
some
simple
graphics
i
m
sure
reentrancy
graphics
library
going
issue
i
suspect
i
ll
implement
display
controller
server
process
handles
graphics
requests
queued
mailbox
one
time
provides
sufficiently
frequent
display
updates
i
believe
i
can
restrict
all
graphics
operations
performed
server
thus
constrain
access
library
single
process
avoid
need
reentrant
graphics
library
being
fairly
new
realtime
systems
world
i
may
overlooking
something
what
do
