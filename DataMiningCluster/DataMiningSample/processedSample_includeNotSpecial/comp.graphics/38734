subject
advice
sought
turning
font
outlines
renderable
polygons
i
am
seeking
some
alternate
solutions
how
turn
postscript
type
truetype
font
outline
polygons
can
subsequently
scan
converted
d
scanline
renderer
i
have
been
studying
problem
font
conversion
few
years
have
never
had
need
implement
system
well
i
now
have
opportunity
write
some
font
rendering
software
so
i
would
like
have
some
my
questions
answered
before
i
jump
deep
end
main
problem
i
face
how
use
even
odd
non
winding
rules
turn
outlines
single
outline
polygon
my
renderer
can
handle
complex
polygons
so
need
reduce
polygons
simple
polygons
example
letter
o
two
outlines
outside
outline
which
clockwise
truetype
font
inside
outline
which
counterclockwise
one
common
solution
used
number
rendering
packages
simply
connect
inner
outline
outer
outline
point
where
two
outlines
closest
equivalent
descibing
polygon
holes
renderer
make
appropriate
hole
since
interior
polygon
edges
opposite
direction
outside
edges
i
do
want
use
simplistic
system
since
handle
all
outline
fonts
properly
simple
matter
connect
outer
outline
inner
outline
some
fancy
fonts
does
properly
handle
even
odd
non
winding
rules
from
my
research
over
years
proper
solution
use
trapezoid
decomposition
algorithm
scan
convert
outlines
trapezoids
done
postscript
truetype
font
rasterizers
trapezoidal
polygons
can
easily
properly
rendered
d
scanline
renderer
my
question
any
better
solutions
turning
outlines
polgyons
other
than
trapezoid
decomposer
i
am
fond
solution
since
creates
excess
number
polygons
another
question
those
know
what
best
algorithm
create
bevelled
offset
curves
font
outlines
i
have
dozen
papers
subjects
i
can
tell
which
method
best
implement
thanks
any
pointers
