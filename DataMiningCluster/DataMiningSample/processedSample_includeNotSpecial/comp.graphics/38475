ellipse
again
hi
everyone
because
one
has
touched
problem
i
posted
last
week
i
guess
my
question
so
clear
now
i
d
like
describe
detail
offset
ellipse
locus
center
circle
which
rolls
ellipse
other
words
distance
between
ellipse
its
offset
same
everywhere
problem
comes
from
geometric
measurement
when
probe
used
tip
probe
ball
computer
just
outputs
positions
ball
center
offset
ellipse
still
ellipse
answer
ironically
dmis
american
indutrial
standard
says
ellipse
so
almost
all
software
which
implemented
base
dmis
wrong
software
also
sold
internationaly
imagine
how
many
people
have
suffer
from
bug
how
many
qualified
parts
ellipse
were
discarded
most
importantly
how
many
defective
parts
ellipse
used
i
employed
consultant
company
los
angeles
last
year
specially
solve
problem
i
spent
two
months
analysis
problem
six
months
programming
now
my
solution
nonlinear
ideal
because
i
can
only
reconstruct
ellipse
from
its
entire
half
offset
very
difficult
find
original
ellipse
from
quarter
segment
its
offset
because
method
i
used
analytical
i
am
now
wondering
i
didn
touch
base
make
things
complicated
please
give
me
hint
i
know
you
may
argue
cg
problem
you
right
however
so
many
people
involved
problem
sphere
from
poits
why
ellipse
why

offset
please
post
here
