i
wrote
something
about
making
color
modifications
quickly
bit
quantized
images
only
saving
image
file
process
we
have
make
modifications
bit
image
makes
sense
because
main
use
xv
only
viewing
images
doing
many
changes
image
we
should
keep
all
modifications
buffer
before
making
operations
bit
image
we
should
simplify
operation
list
unnecessary
operations
think
about
what
you
saying
here
bit
image
quantised
down
bits
so
many
similar
colours
mapped
onto
single
palette
colour
colour
gets
modified
fairly
arbitrary
ways
you
want
apply
modifications
back
bit
file
so
you
have
find
which
colours
mapped
one
palette
colour
i
suppose
you
don
know
what
about
we
have
discussed
we
discussed
about
error
xv
which
shows
images
only
bit
my
suggestion
above
works
perfectly
look
consistent
first
you
post
something
seems
suggest
you
see
xv
being
bit
program
some
sort
error
so
i
post
asy
bug
meant
like
so
you
post
say
bug
you
never
said
i
have
misunderstood
etc
now
you
saying
we
discussed
about
error
xv
which
shows
images
only
bit
you
would
make
up
your
mind
what
you
claiming
would
make
discussion
lot
easier
so
far
i
have
seen
colormap
editing
window
xv
must
colormap
anyway
problems
you
present
exist
anyway
i
didn
tried
solve
them
all
because
i
would
make
problems
my
programs
first
place
eh
sorry
i
don
understand
what
you
saying
here
i
am
aware
english
your
native
language
have
tried
hard
fathom
your
meaning
paragraph
defeats
me
gamma
color
corrections
easily
done
bit
image
i
presented
need
make
tricks
from
bit
quantized
image
back
bit
image
yes
i
originally
said
global
changes
easily
possible
statement
contradicts
what
you
said
earlier
i
wrote
something
about
making
color
modifications
quickly
bit
quantized
images
only
saving
image
file
process
we
have
make
modifications
bit
image
how
would
you
suggest
doing
colour
editing
bit
file
how
would
you
group
related
colours
edit
them
together
only
global
changes
could
done
unless
software
were
very
different
much
more
complicated
ok
you
re
writing
about
situation
user
want
edit
images
bit
user
want
edit
individual
colors
your
questions
way
jumps
off
discussion
bit
i
don
think
so
actually
you
were
talking
about
loading
bit
image
xv
quantising
manipulating
colours
colour
editor
somewhow
applying
changes
bit
file
when
you
exit
xv
xv
lets
you
edit
individual
colours
where
sudden
jumping
off
topic
my
solution
doesn
work
because
colormap
withing
real
bit
image
yes
i
am
aware
colourmap
bit
file
you
see
user
see
bit
image
going
back
bit
silly
i
do
understand
what
statement
supposed
mean
about
changing
individual
colors
bit
quantized
rasterized
image
changing
individual
colors
colormap
useless
most
cases
image
quantized
rasterized
small
change
may
make
serious
errors
anywhere
image
what
you
saying
xv
allows
feature
i
don
recommend
use
mentioned
type
images
ah
now
we
see
thew
problem
first
you
want
extend
xv
allow
editing
bit
previews
bit
images
i
point
out
problems
now
you
saying
problem
because
you
personally
happen
use
those
parts
program
cause
problem
moreover
xv
paint
program
you
can
only
make
those
global
changes
sure
what
you
saying
here
certainly
one
can
make
local
changes
full
bit
xv
changing
individual
colors
sounds
like
paint
program
job
person
have
bit
screen
need
tricks
get
original
bit
image
modified
because
user
don
see
full
bit
image
need
make
approximations
possible
modify
individual
colors
individual
pixels
pixel
groups
image
rasterized
select
indiavidual
color
could
x
cursor
window
which
shows
true
color
image
cursor
window
area
selecting
individual
color
possible
from
yes
one
possible
approach
i
would
find
program
took
approach
clumsy
however
ok
i
don
have
thought
very
much
bit
painting
programs
never
seen
good
view
planned
make
mention
bit
painting
program
bit
screen
well
here
we
agree
you
have
thought
through
very
much
you
don
seem
have
consistent
point
make
contradict
yourself
from
one
post
next
ok
we
all
have
off
days
perhaps
you
should
step
back
think
one
through
yes
again
what
wrong
xv
saved
bit
quantized
rasterized
images
bit
jpegs
jpeg
designed
i
said
last
post
jpeg
compression
algorithm
way
saving
disk
space
trading
off
quality
against
compression
i
fail
see
what
problem
you
have
proposed
any
workable
alternatives
also
human
expect
bit
saved
bit
image
speak
yourself
you
only
person
i
have
met
spoken
who
having
quantised
bit
image
down
bits
expects
process
somehow
reverse
when
file
saved
keeping
all
modificvations
heve
been
made
bit
image
palette
perhaps
why
you
yused
singular
say
person
would
like
crop
part
image
save
expected
image
still
same
look
next
time
you
import
bit
image
xv
look
carefully
main
control
panel
tells
you
how
many
colours
have
been
allocated
bit
image
xv
makes
abundantly
clear
you
editing
original
bit
file
you
only
person
who
claims
confusing
so
xv
were
designed
without
thinking
about
human
interface
how
human
expect
program
work
design
error
design
error
same
bug
read
my
lips
xv
program
viewing
modifying
bit
images
lets
you
import
other
images
shows
i
would
say
good
deal
thought
about
human
interface
everyone
else
seems
use
happily
purpose
designed
makes
false
claims
i
have
heard
xv
were
designed
first
bit
images
files
were
good
idea
take
full
bit
images
without
making
major
change
original
design
you
would
come
up
solid
logical
well
argued
lucid
description
precisely
how
proposed
extensions
would
work
feel
free
post
them
so
far
you
have
done
so
so
even
all
screen
images
bit
processed
images
saved
images
could
have
been
bit
very
easily
instead
bit
argh
after
all
comment
like
very
easily
ok
go
ahead
code
so
easy
alternatively
look
up
terms
import
non
reversible
transformation
before
anybody
make
note
yes
i
may
well
make
lift
where
up
means
lift
goes
down
down
means
lift
goes
up
put
note
design
solution
manuals
however
even
manuals
tells
correct
situation
doesn
solve
problem
americans
lift
just
example
i
think
bit
exageration
what
you
actually
saying
you
got
lift
elevator
you
states
mistakenly
pressed
down
button
go
up
everyone
else
had
problem
now
you
trying
sue
manufacturer
well
my
text
may
bit
hard
reading
you
bet
hopefully
you
suggeeded
read
mostly
leaving
aside
language
issue
however
betrays
some
very
wooly
thinking
you
yourself
admit
which
same
any
language
go
think
some
more
