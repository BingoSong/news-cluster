you
write
anyone
who
thinks
tiff
too
complex
hasn
dealt
cgm
asn
cda
dca
sgml
any
one
number
other
very
successful
file
format
people
seem
perfectly
capable
dealing
others
well
yeah
unlike
tiff
all
do
substantially
more
than
encode
rectangular
bitmaps
others
hardly
trouble
free
i
hear
quite
common
cgm
implementations
interoperate
annoying
thing
about
tiff
along
useful
options
stupid
options
most
egregious
example
rather
than
picking
byte
order
bit
order
using
consistently
all
tiff
files
byte
bit
order
options
all
tiff
readers
all
machines
matter
what
natural
byte
order
have
prepared
do
byte
swapping
four
slightly
different
fax
formats
again
any
one
them
would
have
been
adequate
rgb
images
can
stored
pixel
component
complexity
without
function
etc
etc
i
also
note
tiff
doc
says
aldus
experiments
show
lzw
reliably
compresses
well
better
than
any
fax
formats
suggesting
none
fax
formats
really
useful
what
worse
lot
formats
aren
even
implemented
very
well
e
g
lzw
limits
code
words
bits
while
bits
would
have
provided
substantially
better
compression
lzw
method
compresses
bytes
rather
than
pixels
absolute
worst
thing
about
tiff
any
vendor
can
register
proprietary
tiff
codes
formats
without
even
publicly
documenting
them
means
way
write
tiff
reader
can
reliably
read
all
incoming
tiff
files
some
standard
