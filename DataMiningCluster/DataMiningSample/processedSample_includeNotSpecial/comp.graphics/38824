i
recently
talking
possible
employer
mine
he
made
reference
bit
graphics
computer
image
processing
system
i
seem
remember
being
called
image
something
akin
anyway
he
claimed
had
bit
color
bit
alpha
channel
bits
info
what
could
possibly
specifically
bit
color
trillion
colors
many
more
than
human
eye
can
resolve
anti
aliasing
thing
just
some
magic
number
make
work
better
certain
processor
well
bit
colour
could
improved
resolution
bits
per
channel
seems
like
bit
excessive
i
have
seen
paper
quoted
bits
per
channel
bits
computational
precision
more
than
would
seem
wasted
perhaps
frame
buffer
uses
another
colourspace
which
needs
more
bits
represent
full
range
rgb
cube
so
compact
encoding
most
likely
however
two
separate
bit
bits
per
component
frame
buffers
set
up
called
double
buffering
allows
complex
d
picture
built
up
one
buffer
while
other
buffer
containing
previous
frame
displayed
makes
smoother
animation
sadly
i
have
access
none
them
just
dec
sigh
well
hey
you
want
brag
about
numbers
range
can
take
pxg
turbo
card
bits
per
pixel
full
double
buffering
two
bit
buffers
bit
z
buffer
extra
bit
buffer
off
screen
image
storage
mind
you
card
costs
more
than
your
workstation
