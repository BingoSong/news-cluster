i
ve
seen
digitized
video
some
apple
early
commercials
precise
running
centris
about
fps
very
nicely
bit
color

i
would
expect
using
same
algorithm
risc
processor
should
able
approach
full
screen
full
motion
animation
though
you
ve
implied
processor
taxed
more
highly
dynamic

notice
wasn

about

anymore
dropped
like

he
increased
just
bit
more
dropped
fps
i
asked
him
what
mac
he
using
he
using
quadra
don
know
what
model
do
he
telling
guys
quicktime
could
play
back
same
speed
even
lcii
well
i
spoiled
his
claim
so
say
since
quadra
mac
having
little
bit
trouble
wasn
even
from
hardisk
from

could
you
saw
either
newer
version
quicktime
some

assisted
centris
another
software
product
running

showing

very

note
however
do

resolution
x
compactvideo
pretty
amazing
i
also
wanted
point
out
quicktime
does
indeed
slow
down
when
one
dynamically
resizes
material
stated
above
i
m
sure
material
had
been
compressed
large
size
would
play
back
fine
i
have
q
do
quite
bit
price
generality
personally
i
don
use
dynamic
sizing
movies
often
ever
playing
back
stuff
its
original
size
plenty
quick
latest
machines
i
m
sure
how
centris
mhz
stacks
up
against
mhz
arm
do
box
obviously
arm
faster
