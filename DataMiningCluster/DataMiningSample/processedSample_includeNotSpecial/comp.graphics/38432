embarassing

faq
given
points
non
coplanar
how
does
one
find
sphere
center
radius
exactly
fitting
those
points
i
know
how
do
circle
from
points
do
immediately
see
straightforward
way
do
d
i
have
checked
some
geometry
books
graphics
gems
farin
am
still
loss
please
have
mercy
me
provide
solution
bad
question
i
don
have
any
refs
list
algorithm
either
thinking
about
bit
shouldn
too
hard
take
three
points
find
plane
define
well
circle
lie
you
say
you
have
algorithm
already
find
center
circle
line
passing
through
center
perpendicular
plane
three
points
passes
through
center
sphere
repeat
unused
point
two
original
points
gives
you
two
different
lines
both
pass
through
sphere
origin
interection
center
sphere
radius
easy
compute
just
distance
from
center
any
original
points
i
ll
leave
math
you
workable
algorithm
good
i
had
bad
feeling
about
problem
because
special
case
solution
worried
me
four
coplanar
points
shape
square
have
unique
sphere
surface
similarly
colinear
point
have
finite
sized
sphere
surface
algorithms
being
geometrical
designed
rather
than
algebraically
design
meet
problems
neatly
when
determining
which
plane
points
colinear
algorithm
should
afil
return
infinite
r
when
intersecting
two
lines
possibilities
same
line
points
were
planar
circle
different
lines
parallel
sphere
radius
last
case
can
achieved
colinier
points
any
th
point
taking
th
point
pairs
first
parallel
lines
produced
can
also
achieved
all
points
coplanar
one
circle
seems
me
algorithm
only
fails
when
points
coplanar
algorithm
always
fails
when
points
coplanar
points
being
colinear
coplanar
testing
th
point
coplanar
when
plane
first
points
has
been
found
trivial
alternate
method
would
take
pairs
points
plane
formed
perpendicular
bisector
each
line
segment
pair
also
contains
center
sphere
three
pairs
form
three
planes
intersecting
point
might
easier
implement
