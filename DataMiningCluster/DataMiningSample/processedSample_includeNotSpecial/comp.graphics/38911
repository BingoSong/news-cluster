yup
most
jpeg

seem
require
specific
video
drivers
since

only
specific
video
cards
some
have
standard
ibm
bios
video
support
vga
x
colour
mode
leave
out
other
cards
hercules
monochrome
card
which
way
can
give
very
good
picture
quality
your
dithering
works
right
i
can
remember
name
jpeg
viewer
since
i
usually
convert
jpeg
gif
before
viewing
them
some
require
vesa
driver
video
cards
you
don
need
any
special
hardware
view
jpeg
except
perhaps
vga
card
maybe
processor
most

v
processor
hercules
card
i
have
had
write
some
programs
so
view
gif

vga
other
colour

my
monochrome
hercules

i
use
floyd
steinberg
dithers
have
found
one
does
something
neat
colour
palette
resulting
dithered
image
gives
much
greater
detail
than
normally
would
when
viewed
other
monochrome
systems
compushow
has
fs
dithering
does
standard
thing
image
palette
before
dithering
my
way
gives
brighter
more
detailed
image
anyway
enough
my
rambling
wrong
direction
final
point
far
i
know
you
don
need
extra
hardware
view

other
than

perhaps
better
