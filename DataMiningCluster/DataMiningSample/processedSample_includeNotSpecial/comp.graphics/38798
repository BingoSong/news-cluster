concerning
proposed
newsgroup
split
i
personally
am
favor
doing
i
learn
awful
lot
about
all
aspects
graphics
reading
group
from
code
hardware
algorithms
i
just
think
making
different
groups
out
wate
only
result
few
posts
week
per
group
i
kind
like
convenience
having
one
big
forum
discussing
all
aspects
graphics
anyone
else
feel
way
just
curious
yes
i
also
like
knowing
where
go
ask
question
without
getting
hell
putting
wrong
newsgroup
i
am
also
against
splitting
group
traffic
decrease
any
given
subject
required
net
bandwidth
increase
because
multiply
cross
postings
i
just
went
through
another
group
i
continuously
read
now
almost
point
where
longer
worth
reading
strongly
suggest
doing
