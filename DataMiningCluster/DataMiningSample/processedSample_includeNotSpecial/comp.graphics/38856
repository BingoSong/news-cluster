asking
help
sticky
problem
involving
unreasonably
low
apparent
precision
z
buffering
i
ve
encountered
different
pex
implementations
i
can
find
any
discussion
problem
any
resources
i
can
lay

posting

virtually
same
article
test

demonstrating

comp
windows
x
pex
problem
hard
describe
without
pictures
hence
article
longish
you
can
run
pexlib
x
programs
interested
i
encourage
you
build
run
test

my
approach
dealing

given
problem
solved
eliminate
minimize
stitching
artifacts
resulting
from
use
z
buffering
polylines
coplanar
filled
areas
interpolated
z
values
along
line
differ
slightly
due
roundoff
error
from
interpolated
z
values
across
area
even
when
endpoints
line
coincident

area
because
tossup
whether

even
though

using
pexlib
api
my
approach
solution
use
two
slightly
different
pex
view
mapping
transforms
two
view
table
entries
one
areas
one
lines
pex
structures
immediate
mode
output
must
organized
so
one
view

index
always
effect
areas
other
always
effect
lines
result
slight
shift
npc
z
coordinates
lines
so
attempt
bias
tossup
situations
favor
lines
shift
effected
moving

used
pexlib
view
table
entry
lines
just
hair
backwards
i
e
smaller
vrc
z
coordinates
compared
positions
view
table
entry
used
areas
means
when
point
transformed
npc
its
z
value
slightly
bigger
comes
from
line
than
comes
from
area
thus
accomplishing
desired
bias
i
would
expect
z
roundoff
errors
which
cause
problem
amount
few
units
most
out
entire
dynamic
range
z
buffer
typically
from
i
e
bit
z
buffers
therefore
seems
tiny
fraction
range
z
vrc
between
front
back
clip
planes
ought
suffice
reliably
fix
stitching
fact
experience
shows
shift
has
much
range
empirically
worst
when
npc
z
component
slope
surface
high
i
e
when
appears
more
less
edge
viewer
only
bits
z
buffer
have
any
dependable
meaning
amount
so
great
one
problem
replaced
another
sometimes
polylines
show
through
areas
which
supposed
lie
behind
i
ve
observed

both

approximately

open
questions
why
does
happen
am
i
configuring
pex
view
table
wrongly
systematic
difference
z
interpolation
lines
opposed
areas
e
g
pixel
centers
versus
corners
which
could
corrected
pex
implementors
wantonly
discarding
z

interpolators
something
else
what
do
about
can
i
fix
my
use

allow
better
precision
z

hlhsr
another
approach
i
can
take
remove

am
i
just
out
luck
any
help
would
immensely
appreciated
