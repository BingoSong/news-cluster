i
believe
algorithms
you
can
get
only
draw
convex
polygons
can
much
more
efficient
than
those
can
draw
concave
self
intersecting
polygons
efficiency
can
largely
attributed
fact
simple
convex
polygons
only
have
left
right
edge
each
scan
line
complex
figure
type
polygons
can
bit
trickier
true
convex
algorithm
faster
than
general
concave
multi
outline
algorithm
tremendously
faster
i
spent
awhile
implementing
optimizing
both
flavors
convex
turned
out
about
faster
all
c
hp
pa
risc
compiler
got
inner
loop
shooting
span
fast
possible
far
i
could
tell
any
sort
game
database
render
known
ahead
time
can
made
all
convex
definitely
way
go
p
sorry
my
code
cannot
made
