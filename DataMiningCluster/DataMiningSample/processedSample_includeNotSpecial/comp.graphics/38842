colours
along

r
rcol
tcol
each
object
has
its
own
colour
ocol
each
light
source
has
licol
i

question
how
do
you
combine
rcol
tcol
ocol
all
licol
get
correct
resulting
colour
return
along
i
ray
first
all
snide
response
you
re
confused
about
issue
you
stumble
over
lot
other
things
well
i
suggest
weakness
your
reference
material
get
introduction
ray
tracing
andrew
glassner
very
good
coverage
raytracing
algorithm
you
could
also
refer
nd
edition
foley
van
dam
question
simple
answer
you
just
keep
adding
up
all
contributions
clamping
maximum
intensity
example
your
intensity
values
range
from
keep
adding
up
clamp
resultant
values
you
might
have
clamp
lower
bound
you
have
dark
bulbs
another
issue
so
you
get
some
illumination
equation
like
i
lambient
ldiffuse
light
n
lreflected
ltransparent
contribution
due
reflection
just
summed
light
intensity
light
due
transparency
now
slightly
less
hand
waving
illumination
equation
i
kala
kdld
light
n
krlr
ktlt
each
component
illumination
equation
governed
material
constants
ka
kd
kr
kt
so
maximum
you
can
get
from
transparency
given
object
example
might
purple
colored
glass
object
hopefully
answers
your
question
i
ll
forward
my
illumination
equation
sermon
