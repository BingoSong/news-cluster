i
wrote
something
about
making
color
modifications
quickly
bit
quantized
images
only
saving
image
file
process
we
have
make
modifications
bit
image
makes
sense
because
main
use
xv
only
viewing
images
doing
many
changes
image
we
should
keep
all
modifications
buffer
before
making
operations
bit
image
we
should
simplify
operation
list
unnecessary
operations
think
about
what
you
saying
here
bit
image
quantised
down
bits
so
many
similar
colours
mapped
onto
single
palette
colour
colour
gets
modified
fairly
arbitrary
ways
you
want
apply
modifications
back
bit
file
so
you
have
find
which
colours
mapped
one
palette
colour
i
suppose
you
don
know
what
about
we
have
discussed
we
discussed
about
error
xv
which
shows
images
only
bit
my
suggestion
above
works
perfectly
so
far
i
have
seen
colormap
editing
window
xv
must
colormap
anyway
problems
you
present
exist
anyway
i
didn
tried
solve
them
all
because
i
would
make
problems
my
programs
first
place
gamma
color
corrections
easily
done
bit
image
i
presented
need
make
tricks
from
bit
quantized
image
back
bit
image
how
would
you
suggest
doing
colour
editing
bit
file
how
would
you
group
related
colours
edit
them
together
only
global
changes
could
done
unless
software
were
very
different
much
more
complicated
ok
you
re
writing
about
situation
user
want
edit
images
bit
user
want
edit
individual
colors
your
questions
way
jumps
off
discussion
bit
my
solution
doesn
work
because
colormap
withing
real
bit
image
you
see
user
see
bit
image
going
back
bit
silly
about
changing
individual
colors
bit
quantized
rasterized
image
changing
individual
colors
colormap
useless
most
cases
image
quantized
rasterized
small
change
may
make
serious
errors
anywhere
image
xv
allows
feature
i
don
recommend
use
mentioned
type
images
moreover
xv
paint
program
you
can
only
make
those
global
changes
full
bit
xv
changing
individual
colors
sounds
like
paint
program
job
person
have
bit
screen
need
tricks
get
original
bit
image
modified
because
user
don
see
full
bit
image
need
make
approximations
possible
modify
individual
colors
individual
pixels
pixel
groups
image
rasterized
select
indiavidual
color
could
x
cursor
window
which
shows
true
color
image
cursor
window
area
selecting
individual
color
possible
from
ok
i
don
have
thought
very
much
bit
painting
programs
never
seen
good
view
planned
make
mention
bit
painting
program
bit
screen
yes
again
what
wrong
xv
saved
bit
quantized
rasterized
images
bit
jpegs
jpeg
designed
also
human
expect
bit
saved
bit
image
say
person
would
like
crop
part
image
save
expected
image
still
same
so
xv
were
designed
without
thinking
about
human
interface
how
human
expect
program
work
design
error
i
have
heard
xv
were
designed
first
bit
images
files
were
good
idea
take
full
bit
images
without
making
major
change
original
design
so
even
all
screen
images
bit
processed
images
saved
images
could
have
been
bit
very
easily
instead
bit
before
anybody
make
note
yes
i
may
well
make
lift
where
up
means
lift
goes
down
down
means
lift
goes
up
put
note
design
solution
manuals
however
even
manuals
tells
correct
situation
doesn
solve
problem
americans
lift
just
example
well
my
text
may
bit
hard
reading
hopefully
you
suggeeded
