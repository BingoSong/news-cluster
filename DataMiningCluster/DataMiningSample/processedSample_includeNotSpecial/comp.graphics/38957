who

can
anyone
provide
me
colour
space
transform
would
emulate
effects
red
green
colour
blindness
i
have
had
quick
look
computer
graphics
literature
results
perhaps
someone
who
has
access
medical
information
could
help
certainly
reference
follows
bear
mind
least
two
conditions
which
may
called
red
green
colour
blind
one
protanopia
caused
lack
major
dysfunction
l
cones
those
respond
best
long
wavelengths
gives
much
reduced
red
green
red
violet
discrimination
also
means
reds
look
dimmer
than
than
do
people
normal
vision
other
deuteranopia
due
missing
dysfunctional
m
cones
although
can
also
caused
lack
l
m
cone
difference
signals
retina
also
gives
reduced
red
green
discrimination
red
violet
unaffected
unlike
protanopia
reds
dimmer
than
normal
uniform
chromaticity
diagram
horseshoe
shaped
one
you
see
computer
graphics
books
single
confusion
point
each
type
colour
deficiency
colours
which
confused
lie
straight
lines
radiating
from
point
protanopia
point
u
v
very
close
far
red
corner
deuteranopia
point
u
v
note
different
experimental
investigations
literature
give
slightly
different
values
depending
precise
details
experimental
setup
random
errors
so
values
quoted
typical
so
all
colours
line
seen
same
which
colour
actually
seen
problem
has
now
been
solved
tests
people
one
normal
eye
one
affected
eye
have
shown
axis
each
type
disorder
onto
which
all
colours
collapse
protanopes
joins
up
nm

spectral
locus

horseshoe
deuteranopes

very
similar

so
convert

yes
certainly
possible
you
