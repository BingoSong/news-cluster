where
has
hacker
ethic
gone
cracker
ethic
which
something
entirely
different
bad
hacker
ethic
which
tells
us
value
free
distribution
information
yield
hands
imperative
why
people
corporations
like
bill
gates
ibm
intel
able
have
virtual
dead
lock
computer
industry
why
person
like
myself
posts
messages
usenet
how
get
little
nooks
crannies
idiosyncrasies
computer
system
given
any
useful
information
those
who
know
just
badmouthing
completely
ignored
why
people
like
steve
jobs
have
abandon
efforts
make
truly
innovative
products
i
ask
those
you
who
call
yourselves
hackers
why
further
how
can
you
let
go
fact
computer
industry
has
changed
world
shall
continue
do
so
long
time
come
has
allowed
propagation
information
volume
unheard
even
twenty
years
ago
has
made
world
even
smaller
than
before
i
shudder
think
what
world
like
corporations
allowed
have
way
perpetuating
more
drivel
like
windows
ibm
product
line
computer
using
public
say
i
am
against
business
per
se
people
who
profit
off
innovative
intelligent
creative
designs
do
bother
me
fact
i
applaud
american
way
those
who
manage
sell
kludgy
uncreative
systems
public
profit
off
them
ones
who
problem
unfortunately
because
have
enough
money
make
up
blunt
stupidity
can
keep
doing
very
long
time
i
put
you
thus
where
has
hacker
ethic
gone
still
exists
where
does
exist
why
those
who
call
themselves
hackers
allowing
perpetuate
itself
why
creating
new
innovative
interesting
ideas
stop
sos
from
maintaining
its
choke
hold
computer
industry
i
await
interest
what
probably
resounding
silence
