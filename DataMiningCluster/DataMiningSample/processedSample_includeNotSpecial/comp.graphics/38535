imho

i
m
sure
when
xv
were
designed
bit
displays
were
known
bad
error
program
program
bit
images
only
time
when
bit
image
formats
included
program
whole
design
should
changed
support
bit
images
were
done
now
we
have
program
violate
jpeg
design
any

program
has
human

some

clip
i
have
seen
xv
quantizes
image
sometimes
poorly
best
option
than
default
option
we
have
reason
surely
quantizer
used
best
surprise
same
than
used
ppmquant
you
remember
i
have
tested
some
quantizers
test
i
found
rlequant
default
best
comes
djpeg
fbmquant
xv
our
default
order
my
test
ppmquant
suggeeded
very
poorly
actually
gave
image
bad
artifacts
i
don
know
ppmquant
improved
any
i
expect
so
use
xv
best
option
very
good
idea
i
suggest
author
xv
changes
quantizer
one
used
rlequant
i
m
sure
rle
people
gives
permission
another
could
one
used
imagemagick
i
have
tested
so
i
can
say
nothing
about
clip
clip
some
minor
bugs
human
interface
key
pressings
cursor
clicks
goes
buffer
often
happens
i
make
click
errors
press
keyboard
when
cursor
wrong
place
very
annoying
when
you
have
waited
image
come
about
five
minutes
gone
away
immediately
buffer
should
cleaned
when
image
complete
also
good
idea
wait
few
seconds
before
activating
keyboard
mouse
xv
after
image
completed
often
happens
image
pops
screen
quickly
just
when
i
m
writing
something
editor
those
key
pressings
go
xv
image
has
gone
something
weird
color
editor
when
i
turn
color
meter
release
xv
updates
images
impossible
change
all
rgb
values
first
get
updated
image
annoying
wait
image
updated
when
setting
ready
yet
i
suggest
adding
apply
button
update
