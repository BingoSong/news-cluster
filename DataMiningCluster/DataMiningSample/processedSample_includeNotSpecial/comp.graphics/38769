re
why
does
illustrator
autotrace
so
poorly

richard
j
mcdougald
writes
since
really
thing
decent
raster
vector
conversion
program
tracing
technique
about
simple
stuff
like
b
w
logos
etc
do
pretty
well
while
more
complicated
stuff
goes
haywire
first
only
thing
i
ve
ever
tried
auto
trace
piece
uscg
nautical
chart
using
adobe
illustrator
i
wanted
get
outline
coast
western
long
island
sound
i
simultaneously
suprised
how
good
job
did
disappointed
how
poorly
did
i
suspect
what
i
gave
very
difficult
thing
only
coastline
very
irregular
overlaid
chart
numerous
sets
gridlines
only
lattitude
longitude
loran
grids
well
most
common
mistake
make
whenever
coastline
roughly
parallel
tangent
grid
line
would
take
off
following
gridline
instead
coast
i
think
best
improvement
would
some
sort
interactive
algorithm
would
let
you
step
say
dummy
you
re
going
wrong
way
steve
reisberg
friend
mine
few
years
back
did
his
doctoral
work
analysing
electron
micrographs
filimentous
phage
virii
good
chunk
work
writing
program
take
digitized
micrograph
automatically
trace
centerline
virus
particles
essentially
same
problem
illustrator
tries
solve
its
auto
trace
tool
some
respects
problem
steve
worked
harder
since
he
trying
do
quantitative
analysis
virus
structure
finding
good
centerline
only
first
step
step
which
all
future
analysis
depended
however
other
respects
easier
problem
since
program
could
written
lot
knowledge
about
what
virus
particles
were
supposed
look
like
analysis
could
restricted
those
particles
which
happend
relatively
straight
clean
well
imaged
you
don
always
have
freedom
auto
tracing
real
life
images
any
case
gave
me
some
insight
just
how
difficult
problem
solve
general
case
steve
longer
us
he
his
wife
disappeared
while
vacation
hawaii
couple
years
after
graduated
last
known
location
hiking
densely
wooded
mountainous
area
while
bodies
were
ever
found
presumed
have
been
victim
some
sort
fall
accident
