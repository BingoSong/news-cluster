how
do
you
go
about
orienting
all
normals
same
direction
given
set
points
edges
faces
algorithm
works
well
me
algorithm
attempt
find
outward
facing
normals
first
mark
all
faces
unknown
create
edge
dictionary
allows
you
find
all
faces
sharing
given
edge
where
edge
two
integers
representing
two
shared
vertices
pick
arbitrary
face
mark
counter
clockwise
using
edge
dictionary
orient
all
surrounding
faces
based
orientation
face
recurse
all
surrounding
faces
consistently
orienting
entire
surface
find
average
vertices
surface
using
point
calculate
volume
measurement
taking
account
face
orientation
volume
turns
out
positive
assume
faces
oriented
correctly
negative
reverse
orientations
mark
them
clockwise
any
faces
still
unknown
after
choose
another
face
go
through
algorithm
again
end
faces
marked
clockwise
must
have
indices
reversed
before
facet
normals
found
