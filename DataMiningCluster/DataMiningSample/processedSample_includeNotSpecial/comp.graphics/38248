i
need
find

algorithm
determine
line

i
would
prefer
method
would
do
little
time
possible
i
need
use

i
think
very
difficult
problem
start
lines
polygons
semi
algebraic
sets
which
both
contain
uncountable
number
points
here
few
off
cuff
ideas
first
we
need
check
line
polygon
separated
now
jordan
curve
separation
theorem
says
polygon
divides
plane
exactly
two
open
thus
non
compact
regions
thus
line
lies
completely
inside
polygon
line
lies
completely
outside
polygon
possibly
rarely
happen
line
intersects
polyon
now
phrasing
question
says
line
intersects
polygon
so
decision
problem
one
possibility
decision
model
approach
reduce
question
some
other
well
known

q
try
solve
q
answer
q
gives

original
decision
problem
recent
years
many
geometric
problems
have
been
successfully
modeled
new
language
called
postscript
see
postscript
language

isbn
co
so
given
line
l
polygon
p
we
can
write
postscript
program
draws
line
l
polygon
p
outputs
answer
output
we
mean
program
executes
command
called
showpage
which
actually
prints
page
paper
containing
line
polygon
quick
examination
paper
provides
answer
reduced
problem
q
thus
original
problem
two
small
problems
approach
infinite
number
ways
encode
l
p
reduced
problem
q
so
we
forced
invoke
axiom
choice
equivalently
zorn
lemma
use
axiom
choice
regarded
very
serious
light
days
more
importantly
question
arises
whether
postscript
program
q
actually
output
piece
paper
other
words
halt
now
postscript
expressive
enough
encode
everything
turing
machine
might
do
thus
halting
problem
postscript
undecidable
quite
possible
original
problem
turn
out
undecidable
i
won
even
