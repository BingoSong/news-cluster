what
kind
polygons
shaded
texturemapped
hm
more
comes
play
fast
routines
than
just
polygons
would
nice
know
exaclty
what
system
vga
start
what
processor
few
specifics
implementation
you
need
give
more
info
you
want
get
any
answers
p
i
don
want
texture
mapped
cause
i
did
i
d
asked
them
just
simple
fast
routine
do
filled
polygons
processor
d
minimum
maybe
i
can
find
good
one
ideally
i
want
polyn
function
can
clip
user
defined
viewport
write
arbitrary
location
memory
course
chances
ok
game
d
you
have
listed
characteristics
you
looking
i
think
you
may
have
left
out
few
important
parameters
polygons
all
convex
have
less
than
n
sides
you
drawing
meshes
walls
doors
etc
i
believe
algorithms
you
can
get
only
draw
convex
polygons
can
much
more
efficient
than
those
can
draw
concave
self
intersecting
polygons
efficiency
can
largely
attributed
fact
simple
convex
polygons
only
have
left
right
edge
each
scan
line
complex
figure
type
polygons
can
bit
trickier
less
than
n
sides
specification
especially
very
small
number
like
allow
othe
optimisations
made
thus
high
speed
game
application
i
think
you
looking
code
exploits
hence
limited
drawing
simple
convex
polygons
finding
something
like
pretty
remote
so
i
guess
i
d
need
source
oh
i
guess
would
need
asm
otherwise
d
too
slow
i
ve
seen
some
polygon
routines
c
ve
all
been
waaay
too
slow
its
d
vector
graphics
program
i
ve
been
hunting
high
low
may
have
been
were
very
general
purpose
algorithms
you
limit
yourself
four
sided
simple
convex
polygons
i
think
you
might
suprised
how
fast
c
algorithm
asm
block
move
fill
each
scan
line
might
actually
polyn
function
asm
i
can
find
one
anywhere
i
can
use
i
ve
found
one
two
polyn
functions
my
asm
pretty
bad
so
i
won
even
try
rewrite
them
