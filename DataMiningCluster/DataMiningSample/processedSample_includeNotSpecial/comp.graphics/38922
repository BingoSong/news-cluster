virtual
sound
what
i
want
do
following
from
fast
source
eg
cdrom
several
sound
sources
read
each
having
own
defined
position
other
attributes
eg
direction
etc
given
listeners
position
direction
sum
sound
played
back
each
listeners
earphones
function
position
direction
means
some
simulation
ears
coloring
sound
relative
incoming
direction
have
done
each
sound
source
i
think
possible
do
lookup
table
impulse
responses
several
angles
relative
each
ear
interpolate
impulse
function
from
given
angle
impulse
function
could
convoluted
sound
from
source
impulse
function
must
changed
every
time
some
sound
source
changes
position
listener
changes
orientation
additionally
some
reflection
diffusion
absorbtion
due
environment
wich
defined
could
simulated
requires
some
sort
sound
propagandation
simulation
kinda
like
some
radiosity
algorithm
have
someone
done
written
articles
implementing
system
please
post
mail
any
answers
