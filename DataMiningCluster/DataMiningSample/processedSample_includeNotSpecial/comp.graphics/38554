what
i
am
annoyed
about
fact
we
were
led
believe
we
would
able
upgrade
multiprocessor
version
crimson
without
assistance
fork
lift
truck
should
have
been
made
fairly
clear
most
crimson
would
ever
get
old
style
mhz
cpu
upgrade
certainly
mentioned
comp
sys
sgi
more
than
one
occasion
being
likely
our
sales
folks
were
saying
otherwise
were
either
confused
less
than
honest
ethical
somebody
further
up
chain
inside
sgi
misleading
them
i
m
also
annoyed
about
being
sold
several
personal
irises
previous
site
understanding
architecture
would
around
while
rather
than
being
flushed
were
versions
although
admittedly
came
out
same
time
over
period
years
chassis
simply
couldn
pushed
any
further
i
d
say
years
pretty
good
lifespan
myself
system
design
day
age
getting
work
caused
lot
gray
hairs
both
hardware
product
design
groups
we
would
have
been
out
our
minds
push
further
i
know
made
clear
almost
from
day
started
shipping
we
had
one
last
kicker
form
elan
graphics
which
made
graphics
versions
over
its
lifespan
which
i
also
think
pretty
good
now
i
understand
sgi
responsible
its
investors
has
keep
showing
positive
quarterly
bottom
line
odd
i
found
myself
pressured
least
two
occasions
get
business
books
just
before
end
quarter
i
m
just
little
tired
getting
boned
process
please
all
means
send
complaint
letter
through
sgi
support
sales
your
concerns
should
reason
sales
folks
misrepresent
future
upgrades
customers
sure
sometimes
confusion
while
over
whether
upgrade
available
shouldn
last
too
long
doesn
seem
what
you
referring
yes
sales
folks
do
get
bonus
end
some
all
quarters
pretty
common
industry
wide
sometimes
can
result
good
deals
customers
sometimes
probably
pushes
folks
systems
aren
what
need
i
m
sure
nobody
forcing
you
buy
end
quarter
after
all
maybe
because
my
lab
buys
sgis
onesies
twosies
so
we
aren
entitled
peek
under
covers
big
kids
nasa
instance
lab
i
suspect
lot
other
labs
don
get
all
long
lead
time
either
although
certainly
get
presentations
possible
new
products
opinions
may
well
influence
end
product
also
life
industry
we
can
design
systems
meet
just
needs
we
won
sell
too
many
systems
after
all
which
say
we
don
have
some
niche
products
like
reality
engine
organizations
doesn
have
load
money
spend
computers
every
year
so
we
can
out
buying
new
systems
regular
basis
boxes
we
buy
now
have
last
us
pretty
much
through
entire
grant
period
five
years
some
case
beyond
means
i
need
buy
best
piece
equipment
i
can
when
i
have
money
some
product
built
paraphrase
one
previous
poster
words
fill
niche
compete
some
other
vendor
i
m
going
looking
box
next
five
years
every
time
i
look
i
m
going
think
about
sgi
how
i
could
have
better
spent
my
money
actually
your
money
since
we
re
supported
almost
entirely
federal
tax
dollars
surely
you
don
expect
system
you
buy
now
five
year
period
constantly
upgradable
over
entire
five
year
period
rather
unreasonable
expectation
my
experience
workstations
microcomputers
supported
parts
available
yes
certainly
upgradable
latest
greatest
now
you
ll
have
pardon
me
while
i
go
off
hiss
fume
corner
somewhere
think
dark
libelous
thoughts
i
missed
your
first
posting
i
say
all
means
share
your
frustation
somebody
level
inside
sgi
where
might
have
effect
immediate
i
m
sure
complaints
aren
going
ignored
may
affect
future
plans
we
hear
similar
things
from
more
than
one
person
site
all
above
usual
my
personal
opinion
sgi
let
one
tell
me
silence
gives
consent
dave
olson
because
whoever
silent
dissents
