himself
he
asked
me
post
him
leave
his
name
out
so
here
comes
cview
has
quite
number
bugs
one
you
mention
perhaps
most
annoying
most
dangerous
far
i
can
determine
has
do
temp
files
cview
creates
cview
gives
user
control
over
where
places
its
temp
files
just
places
them
its
current
directory
problem
you
mention
occurs
far
i
can
tell
when
runs
out
disk
space
its
temp
files
seems
cview
doesn
check
properly
situation
cview
decodes
jpeg
seems
write
out
temp
file
all
pixel
data
bit
colour
information
bit
displays
does
dithering
again
writing
another
file
bit
colour
information
while
writing
second
file
also
writes
data
your
colour
card
when
does
last
chunk
bit
data
recopies
all
data
from
bit
file
your
screen
again
does
last
recopy
operation
its
fit
screen
feature
even
when
feature
enabled
result
process
following
runs
out
disk
space
when
writing
first
bit
file
all
you
ever
see
much
data
has
room
last
bit
data
simply
repeated
over
over
again
because
cview
never
realizes
disk
has
filled
up
disk
writes
reads
aren
performed
has
enough
room
bit
data
runs
out
room
bit
data
you
see
almost
all
picture
does
dithering
writes
screen
card
however
when
finishes
dithering
recopies
data
from
bit
file
screen
whatever
reason
does
one
again
just
gets
repetition
last
chunk
data
which
room
disk
just
guess
probably
fairly
accurate
least
general
idea
track
i
think
although
i
have
probably
made
errors
details
about
file
i
o
etc
way
around
course
clear
up
sufficient
disk
space
temp
files
large
jpeg
x
bigger
can
very
large
meg
meg
some
largest
i
have
needed
excess
meg
free
disk
space
cview
has
much
more
serious
bug
you
trying
display
file
from
floppy
you
change
floppies
while
cview
has
some
temp
file
open
floppy
cview
certain
circumstances
write
directory
fat
table
i
can
remember
removed
floppy
onto
newly
inserted
floppy
thus
corruptimg
new
floppy
very
serious
possibly
unrevcoverable
way
so
careful
incredibly
poor
programming
program
do
other
hand
when
choosing
files
open
files
menu
cview
insists
doing
few
disk
reads
every
time
one
moves
hi
lighter
square
incredibly
annoying
when
could
do
them
all
once
when
gets
directory
info
really
how
much
effort
does
take
sort
directory
listing
much
