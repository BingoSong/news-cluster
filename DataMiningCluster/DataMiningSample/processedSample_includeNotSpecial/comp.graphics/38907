you
who

entire
earth
cloudcover
removed
i
just
think
really
cool
created
government
funds
sattelites
research
project
so
i
would
assume
public
domain
thanks
any

so
i
doubt
you
ll
find
legally
public
domain
part
proceeds
from
sale
image
go
geosphere
project
environmental
education
thing
cost
nominal
so
crack
buy

also
i
don
think
always
safe
assume
just
because
government
funded
project
any
products
provided
free
many
government
agencies
nasa
noaa
some
private
groups
national
geographic
provided
assistance
geosphere
project
collaboration
seems
mostly
oriented
educating
public
rather
than
pure
research
