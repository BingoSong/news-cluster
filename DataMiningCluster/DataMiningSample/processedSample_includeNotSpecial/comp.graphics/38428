animation
playback
which
lawrence
referring
earlier
post
plain
old
quicktime
compact
video
codec
i
ve
seen
digitized
video
some
apple
early
commercials
precise
running
centris
about
fps
very
nicely
bit
color
depth
i
would
expect
using
same
algorithm
risc
processor
should
able
approach
full
screen
full
motion
animation
though
you
ve
implied
processor
taxed
more
highly
dynamic
material
sean
i
don
want
get
mini
war
what
i
am
going
say
i
have
little
bit
skeptic
about
performance
you
claiming
centris
you
ll
see
why
please
flames
i
reserve
those
c
m
i
chicago
last
consumer
electronics
show
apple
had
booth
i
walked
were
showing
real
time
video
capture
using
radious
supermac
card
digitize
make
right
spot
quicktime
movies
i
think
quicktime
were
using
old
one
fact
current
version
only
came
out
december
digitized
guy
talking
x
xx
something
played
back
quite
nicely
real
time
guy
expanded
window
resized
x
xx
y
i
think
frame
rate
decreased
enough
notice
wasn
fps
about
fps
anymore
dropped
like
fps
he
increased
just
bit
more
dropped
fps
i
asked
him
what
mac
he
using
he
using
quadra
don
know
what
model
do
he
telling
guys
quicktime
could
play
back
same
speed
even
lcii
well
i
spoiled
his
claim
so
say
since
quadra
mac
having
little
bit
trouble
wasn
even
from
hardisk
from
memory
my
test
movie
created
resolution
wasn
being
scaled
up
scaling
very
cpu
intensive
operation
original
quicktime
current
version
has
optimizations
ratios
like
even
so
i
m
prepared
believe
performance
isn
good
playing
back
actual
movie
i
haven
done
any
numerical
measurements
scaled
