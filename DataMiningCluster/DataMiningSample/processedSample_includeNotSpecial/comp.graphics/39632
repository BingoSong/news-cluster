thanks
i
get
regular
questions
about
gamma
correction
since
i
go
great
pains
deal

what
all
gamma
stuff
anyway
although
would
nice
think
image
image
lot
complications
only
whole
bunch
different
image
formats
gif
jpeg
tiff
etc
etc
whole
lot
other
technical
stuff
makes
dealing
images
bit
complicated
gamma
one
those
things
you
ve
ever
downloaded
images
from
bbs
net
you
ve
probably
noticed
most
image
viewing
programs
some
images
look
ok
some
look
too
dark
some
look
too
light
why
you
may
ask
gamma
correction
lack
why
do
we
need
gamma
correction
all
gamma
correction
needed
because
nature
crts
cathode
ray
tubes
monitors
usually
used
viewing
images
you
have
some
sort
real
live
scene
turn
computer
image
measuring
amount
light
coming
from
each
point
scene
you
have
created
linear
un
gamma
corrected
image
good
thing
many
ways
because
you
can
manipulate
image
values
image
file
were
light
ie
adding
multiplying
work
just
like
real
light
real
world
now
you
take
image
file
turn
each
pixel
value
voltage
feed
crt
you
find
crt
doesn
give
you
amount
light
proportional
voltage
amount
light
coming
from
phosphor
screen
depends
voltage
something
like
light
out
voltage
crt
gamma
so
you
just
dump
your
nice
linear
image
out
crt
image
look
much
too
dark
fix
up
you
have
gamma
correct
image
first
you
need
do
opposite
what
crt
do
image
so
things
cancel
out
you
get
what
you
want
so
you
have
do
your
image
gamma
corrected
image
image
crt
gamma
most
crts
crt
gamma
somewhere
between
all
why
does
seem
so
complicated
problem
all
display
programs
do
gamma
correction
also
all
sources
images
give
you
linear
images
video
cameras
video
signals
general
because
lot
images
already
have
some
gamma
correction
done
them
you
rarely
sure
how
much
you
try
display
one
those
images
program
does
gamma
correction
you
image
gets
corrected
twice
looks
way
light
you
display
one
those
images
program
doesn
do
gamma
correction
look
vaguely
right
perfect
because
gamma
correction
exactly
right
you
particular
crt
whose
fault
all
really
three
things
one
all
those
display
programs
out
don
do
gamma
correction
properly
another
most
image
formats
don
specify
standard
gamma
don
have
some
way
recording
what
gamma
correction
third
thing
many
people
understand
what
gamma
correction
all
about
create
lot
images
varying
gamma
least
two
file
formats
do
right
thing
utah
graphics
toolkit
rle
format
has
semi
standard
way
recording
gamma
image
jfif
file
standard
uses
jpeg
compression
specifies
image
encoded
must
have
gamma
ie
linear
image
everyone
obeys
rules
some
image
loaders
instance
xli
x
image
utility
allow
you
specify
only
gamma
monitor
you
using
individual
gamma
values
image
you
trying
view
other
image
viewers
eg
xv
another
x
image
program
utilities
eg
pbm
toolkit
provide
ways
changing
gamma
image
you
have
figure
out
overall
gamma
correction
yourself
allowing
undoing
any
gamma
correction
image
has
gamma
correction
you
need
suite
your
crt
monitor
note
xv
doesn
provide
easy
way
modifying
gamma
image
you
need
adjust
r
g
b
curves
appropriate
gamma
coledit
controls
altering
intensity
hsv
controls
doesn
do
right
thing
fails
take
account
effect
gamma
has
h
tends
give
tint
image
how
can
i
figure
out
what
my
viewer
does
what
gamma
my
screen
has
simplest
way
do
try
loading

almost
exactly

flag
once
you
ve
got
right
you
can

environment

your
profile
how
do
i
figure
out
what
gamma
image
most
tricky
bit
general
rule
seems
lot
true
color
ie
bit
ppm
jpg
images
have
gamma
linear
although
many
about
have
some
gamma
correction
seems
majority
pseudo
color
images
ie
bit
images
color
maps
gif
etc
gamma
corrected
some
degree
other
your
viewer
does
gamma
correction
linear
images
look
good
gamma
corrected
images
look
too
light
your
viewer
doesn
do
gamma
correction
linear
images
look
too
dark
gamma
corrected
images
ok
why
linear
images
sometimes
good
thing
one
reason
many
high
quality
formats
video
use
gamma
correction
actually
makes
better
use
storage
medium
because
human
eye
has
logarithmic
response
light
gamma
correction
has
similar
compression
characteristic
means
images
could
make
better
use
bits
per
color
instance
used
gamma
correction
implication
though
every
time
you
want
do
any
image
processing
you
should
convert
bit
image
so
linear
bits
retain
same
accuracy
since
little
popular
software
does
none
popular
image
formats
can
agree
standard
gamma
correction
factor
difficult
justify
gamma
corrected
images
popular
level
some
image
formats
can
standardize
particular
gamma
image
manipulation
software
takes
care
use
extra
precision
when
dealing
linearized
internal
data
gamma
corrected
distribution
images
would
good
thing
i
am
told
kodak
photocd
format
instance
has
standard
gamma
correction
factor
enables
get
highest
quality
out
bits
used
hold
