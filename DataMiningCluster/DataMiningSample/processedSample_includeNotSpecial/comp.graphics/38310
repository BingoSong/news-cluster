hi
steve
author
multiverse
i
feel
i
had
better
respond
your
mailnote
questioning
whether
anyone
had
managed
compile
software
quick
answer
yes
long
answer
yes
few
have
had
few
problems
platforms
all
unix
same
you
know
far
many
bugs
go
would
probably
more
useful
everyone
including
you
you
were
bit
more
explicit
platforms
has
succesfully
compiled
run
rs
dec
ultrix
sun
solaris
so
possible
main
problem
i
don
have
access
other
platforms
than
rs
so
portability
problems
only
way
i
hear
about
them
people
letting
me
know
giving
me
clue
how
fix
far
software
doing
anything
do
you
really
think
i
would
bother
releasing
case
perhaps
you
didn
read
few
docs
supplied
dogfight
world
made
up
clients
only
so
you
re
your
own
you
re
going
see
anything
dactyl
world
has
quite
lot
scenary
so
you
don
see
anything
definitely
problem
one
final
word
you
re
interested
don
bother
you
interested
please
remember
i
m
asking
any
money
so
why
try
little
patience
constructive
criticism
maybe
get
results
