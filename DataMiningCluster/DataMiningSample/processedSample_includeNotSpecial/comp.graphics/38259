hi
everyone
i
thought
some
people
may
interested
my
vr
software
groups
announcing
release
multiverse
multiverse
multi
user
non
immersive
x
windows
based
virtual
reality
system
primarily
focused
entertainment
research
features
client
server
based
model
using
berkeley
sockets
limit
number
users
apart
from
performance
generic
clients
customizable
servers
hierachical
objects
allowing
attachment
cameras
light
sources
multiple
light
sources
ambient
point
spot
objects
can
have
extension
code
handle
unique
functionality
easily
attached
functionality
client
client
built
around
fast
render
loop
basically
changes
things
when
told
server
renders
image
from
user
viewpoint
also
provides
server
information
about
user
actions
which
can
communicated
other
clients
therefore
other
users
client
designed
generic
other
words
you
don
need
develop
new
client
when
you
want
enter
new
world
means
resources
can
spent
enhancing
client
software
rather
than
adapting
adaptations
explained
moment
occur
servers
release
client
software
supports
following
functionality
o
hierarchical
objects
associated
addressing
o
multiple
light
sources
types
ambient
point
spot
o
user
interface
panels
o
colour
polygonal
rendering
phong
shading
optional
wireframe
faster
frame
rates
o
mouse
keyboard
input
some
people
may
disappointed
software
doesn
support
powerglove
input
device
because
can
because
i
don
have
one
however
one
first
enhancements
server
where
customization
can
take
place
following
basic
support
provided
release
potential
world
server
developers
o
transparent
client
management
o
client
message
handling
may
sound
like
much
takes
away
headache
accepting
terminating
clients
receiving
messages
from
them
application
writer
can
work
assumption
things
happening
locally
things
get
more
interesting
object
extension
functionality
what
provided
allow
you
animate
your
objects
o
server
selectable
extension
installation
what
means
you
can
decide
which
objects
have
extended
functionality
your
world
basically
you
call
extension
initialisers
you
want
o
event
handler
registration
when
you
develop
extensions
object
you
basically
write
callback
functions
events
you
want
object
respond
current
events
supported
init
move
change
collide
terminate
o
collision
detection
registration
you
want
your
object
respond
collision
events
just
provide
some
basic
information
collision
detection
management
software
your
callback
activated
when
collision
occurs
software
kept
separate
from
worldserver
applications
because
application
developer
wants
build
library
extended
objects
from
which
choose
following
all
you
need
make
world
server
application
o
provide
initworld
function
where
you
choose
what
object
extensions
supported
plus
any
initialization
you
want
do
o
provide
positionobject
function
where
you
determine
where
place
new
client
o
provide
installworldobjects
function
where
you
load
world
wld
file
new
client
o
provide
getworldtype
function
where
you
tell
new
client
what
persona
should
have
o
provide
animateworld
function
where
you
can
go
wild
minimum
you
should
let
objects
move
calling
move
function
let
server
sleep
bit
avoid
outrunning
clients
all
prove
here
line
counts
three
world
servers
i
ve
provided
generic
lines
dactyl
lines
more
complicated
collision
detection
due
stairs
probably
improved
future
versions
dogfight
lines
location
software
located
following

ftp
u
washington
edu
directory
pub
virtual

multiverse
tar
z
futures
client
o
texture
mapping
o
more
realistic
rendering
i

o
etc
etc
server
o
physical

friction
etc
o
enhanced

interaction
o
etc
etc
both
o
improved
comms
i
hope
provides
people
good
understanding
multiverse
software
unfortunately
comes
practically
zero
documentation
i
m
sure
whether
ever
able
rectified
i
hope
people
enjoy
software
useful
our
explorations
virtual
universe
i
ve
certainly
found
fascinating
developing
i
would
love
add
support
powerglove
hmd
finally
one
major
disclaimer
totally
amateur
code
i
mean
support
code
other
than
what
i
out
kindness
my
heart
you
out
pure
desperation
provide
i
cannot
