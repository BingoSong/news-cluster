what

method
i
have
seen
described
algiorithm
seems
little
bit
long
i
developed
my
own
method
which
requires
points
counter
clockwise
order
returns
whether
you
looking
back
front
similar
plane
eqn
method
uses
few
calculations
however
basically
several
comparisons
only
disadvantage
i
see
must
done
after
transformation
from
view
coordinates
coordinates
display
screen
which
means
little
more
calculation
isneeded
beforehand
my
method
basically
figures
out
whether
points
appear
screen
clockwise
counterclockwise
when
looking
back
something
points
occur
opposite
direction
from
front
so
merely
figuring
out
which
way
points
go
you
can
tell
whether
you
looking
back
front
d
polygon
has
anyone
heard
method
before
so
simple
i
doubt
i
