yes
i
am
aware
coreldraw
exports
scodal
you
try
export
scodal
bitmap
say
something
like
cannot
export
anyone
out
knows
way
around
i
am
all
ears
i
think
one
ideal
solution
use
tracing
utility
can
remember
name
sorry
included
corel
draw
w
pack
can
convert
bitmaps
corel
art
format
can
imported
drawing
rather
than
bitmap
result
file
completely
corel
format
can
scodal
ed
problem
slight
problem
which
makes
solution
less
than
idea
trace
utility
spits
out
many
more
points
than
necessary
define
shapes
being
traced
straight
lines
curves
both
traced
many
short
segments
so
scodal
taking
much
longer
image
obvious
solution
time
consuming
stripping
out
extra
points
hand
using
corel
ouch
i
ve
done
few
times
i
just
wondering
anything
out
just
did
bitmap
scodal
part
tad
cheaper
jeff
lyall
i
say
you
don
mind
problems
go
via
route
bitmap
corel
via
trace
hand
trimming
using
corel
combine
main
corel
pic
via
import
scodal
