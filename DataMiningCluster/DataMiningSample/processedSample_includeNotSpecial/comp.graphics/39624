pov
file
given
line
i
had
hoped
would
let
me
do
simple
animation
however
i
have
discovered
simply
performing
incremental
rotations
object
spin
stationary
object
actually
rotate
object
about
axis
now
i
know
easy
way
around
would
first
translate
object
origin
perform
rotation
move
back
i
know
must
another
way
around
i
had
thought
perhaps
because
i
had
created
objects

translated
them
new
point
done
rotation
which
could
cause
behavior
however
occurs
objects
translated
