can
you
please
offer
some
recommendations
really
hard
do
books
out
which
explain
everything
basic
d
functions
translation
rotation
shading
hidden
line
removal
pretty
easy
i
wrote
program
few
weeks
witht
he
help
book
would
happy
give
you
my
source
i
think
he
wanted
avoid
reinventing
wheel
i
would
suggest
you
take
your
code
submit
comp
sys
mac
binaries
distributed
including
ftp
sites
many
folks
myself
included
would
enjoy
extra
code
also
quickdraw
has
lot
d
functions
built
think
pascal
can
access
them
i
would
expect
think
c
could
well
you
can
find
out
how
use
quickdraw
graphics
library
would
excellent
choice
since
has
lot
stuff
built
mac
so
should
fast
just
clarify
d
routines
mentioned
various
places
mac
libray
rom
mac
few
years
ago
before
i
knew
anything
about
implementing
graphics
i
came
across
demo
apple
grafsys
d
library
actually
did
lot
however
quite
limited
sense
low
level
d
library
your
code
still
has
plot
individual
points
draw
each
line
etc
ad
nauseum
has
nothing
gl
example
where
you
can
handle
objects
other
things
consider
when
talking
about
apple
old
d
grafsys
library
unsupported
never
plans
exist
do
so
future
undocumented
unless
you
call
header
files
documentation
one
knows
something
about
graphics
you
could
probably
figure
out
i
d
assume
better
software
available
gives
better
output
same
time
programmatically
nicer
i
e
easier
program
just
my
