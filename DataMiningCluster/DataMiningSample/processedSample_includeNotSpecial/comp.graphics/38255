according
tiff
specification
tiff
version
number
bytes
has
been
chosen
its
deep
philosophical
significance
last
week
i
read
hitchhikers
guide
galaxy
actually
how
picked
number
i
m
sure
i
am
amused
every
time
i
read
part
tiff
spec
infuriates
me
i
m
none
too
happy
about
complexity
spec
anyway
because
i
think
arbitrary
carefully
chosen
number
neither
additionally
i
find
choice
bytes
begin
file
meaningless
themselves
why
just
use
letters
tiff
i
don
think
should
have
bothered
support
both
word
orders
either
i
ve
found
many
tiff
readers
actually
don
ab

so
up
tight
matter
tiff

why
gripe
about
its
problems
also
its
so
important
you
volunteer
help
define
critique
spec
finally
