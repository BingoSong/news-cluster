outlining
spline
surface
about
year
ago
i
started
work
problem
appeared
very
simple
turned
out
quite
difficult
i
am
wondering
anyone
net
has
seen
problem
hopefully
some
published
solutions
problem
draw
outline
surface
defined
two
roughly
parallel
cubic
splines
inputs
problem
essentially
starts
two
sets
points
where
each
set
points
edge
object
which
we
treat
two
dimensional
i
e
only
extant
between
edges
which
exists
three
dimensional
space
draw
object
we
fit
cubic
spline
through
points
each
spline
effectively
computed
sequence
line
segments
approximating
curve
each
spline
has
equal
number
segments
we
assume
nth
segment
along
each
spline
roughly
exactly
same
distance
along
each
spline
any
reasonable
measure
take
each
segment
n
along
each
spline
match
nth
segment
opposing
spline
use
pair
segments
form
two
triangles
which
filled
color
surface
depth
sort
triangles
take
each
triangle
sorted
order
project
onto
d
pixmap
draw
color
triangle
take
edge
triangle
along
edge
surface
draw
line
along
edge
colored
special
edge
color
edge
coloring
step
heart
problem
idea
effectively
outline
edge
surface
net
result
however
generally
has
lots
breaks
gaps
edge
surface
reasons
fairly
complicated
involve
both
rasterization
problems
problems
resulting
from
projecting
splines
anything
about
problem
sounds
familiar
we
would
appreciate
knowing
about
other
work
area
thanks
