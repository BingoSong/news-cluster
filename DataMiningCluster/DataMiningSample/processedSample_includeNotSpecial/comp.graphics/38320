boy
embarassing
trivial
faq
given
points
non
coplanar
how
does
one
find
sphere
center
radius
exactly
fitting
those
points
i
know
how
do
circle
from
points
do
immediately
see
straightforward
way
do
d
i
have
checked
some
geometry
books
graphics
gems
farin
am
still
loss
please
have
mercy
me
provide
solution
bad
question
i
don
have
any
refs
list
algorithm
either
thinking
about
bit
shouldn
too
hard
take
three
points
find
plane
define
well
circle
lie
you
say
you
have
algorithm
already
find
center
circle
line
passing
through
center
perpendicular
plane
three
points
passes
through
center
sphere
repeat
unused
point
two
original
points
gives
you
two
different
lines
both
pass
through
sphere
origin
interection
center
sphere
radius
easy
compute
just
distance
from
center
any
original
points
i
ll
leave
math
you
workable
algorithm
alternate
method
would
take
pairs
points
plane
formed
perpendicular
bisector
each
line
segment
pair
also
contains
center
sphere
three
pairs
form
three
planes
intersecting
point
might
easier
implement
