how
do
i
compensate
photographic
viewpoint
distortion
hi
all
out
we
have
problem
i
m
certain
i
m
solving
correct
way
i
wondering
anyone
can
shed
light
point
me
right
place
look
we
have
x
ray
imaging
camera
metallic
tube
cylindrical
hole
passing
through
right
angle
tube
axis
image
x
ray
source
screen
metallic
tube
we
know
source
screen
centre
distance
radius
tube
radius
hole
we
do
some
calculations
based
image
hole
screen
however
calculations
mathematically
highly
complex
must
assume
object
hole
projects
image
resembling
ellipse
tube
parallel
screen
centre
screen
however
unlikely
object
placed
so
conveniently
firstly
we
must
transform
major
minor
axis
ellipse
i
cannot
know
what
angle
between
tube
screen
do
i
have
assume
parallel
do
transformation
how
do
i
do
transformation
secondly
distortion
image
due
screen
being
planar
source
screen
distance
increases
we
move
away
from
centre
screen
how
can
i
compensate
ellipse
axis
image
distortion
so
please
can
anyone
give
us
few
pointers
here
how
do
we
transform
image
so
appears
would
were
centre
screen
how
do
i
deal
distortion
due
shape
screen
we
d
appreciate
any
help
either
