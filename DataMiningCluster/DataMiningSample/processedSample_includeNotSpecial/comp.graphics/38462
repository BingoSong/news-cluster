let
say
you
have
scanned
image
line
drawing
case
boat
could
anything
drawing
you
have
set
reference
points
whose
true
x
y
positions
known
now
you
digitize
drawing
manually
case
using
yaron
danon
excellent
digitize
program
you
use
program
which
converts
cursor
positions
x
y
saves
those
values
when
you
click
mouse
upon
digitizing
you
notice
reference

values
come

digitizing
process
differ
small
significant
ways
from

understandable

what
have
you
errors
uniform
over
entire
drawing
so
global
adjustments
stretching
contracting
uniformly
over

y
rotating
whole

satisfactory
so
question
does
any
kind
soul
know
algorithm
removing

particular
i
have
three

essentially
you

you

re
triangulating
points
using
current
positions
still
calculating
digitizedlength
from
original
positions
when
we
first
did
triangulation
time
prohibitive
so
we
only
did
once
i
were
motivated
try
change
code
has
been
working

mode
years
i
might
go
back
re
triangulate
every
iteration
you
have
more
compute
power
than
you
know
what
do
you
might
consider
having
every
point
interact
every
other
