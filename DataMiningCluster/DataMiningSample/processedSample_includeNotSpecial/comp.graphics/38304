what
i
am
annoyed
about

we
were
led
believe
we
would
able
upgrade

your

mislead
you
you
should
have
valid
grievance
against

which
you
should
carry

we
understand
repeat

come
from

now
i
understand
sgi
responsible
its
investors
has
keep
showing
positive
quarterly
bottom
line
odd
i
found
myself
pressured
least
two
occasions
get
business
books
just
before
end
quarter
i
m
just
little
tired
getting
boned
process
happening
becausing
misunderstandings
mis
communication
because
sgi
directly
attempting
annoy
our
customer
base
maybe
because
my
lab
buys
sgis
onesies
twosies
so
we
aren
entitled
peek
under
covers
big
kids
nasa
instance
lab
i
suspect
lot
other
labs
organizations
doesn
have
load
money
spend
computers
every
year
so
we
can
out
buying
new
systems
regular
basis
most
sgi
customers
onesy
twosey
types
regardless
we
rarely
give
great
deal
notice
when
we
about
introduce
new
system
because
again
like
previous
post
stated
we
pre
announced
schedule
slipped
we
would
mess
up
our
potential
customers
schedules
when
were
counting
availability
new
systems
particular
date
would
also
look
awfully
bad
both
our
investors
financial
analysts
who
watch
us
most
carefully
see
we
meeting
our
commitments
boxes
we
buy
now
have
last
us
pretty
much
through
entire
grant
period
five
years
some
case
beyond
means
i
need
buy
best
piece
equipment
i
can
when
i
have
money
some
product
built
paraphrase
one
previous
poster
words
fill
niche
compete
some
other
vendor
i
m
going
looking
box
next
five
years
every
time
i
look
i
m
going
think
about
sgi
how
i
could
have
better
spent
my
money
actually
your
money
since
we
re
supported
almost
entirely
federal
tax
dollars
five
years
awfully
long
time
computer
years
new
processor
technologies
arriving
every
years
making
year
old
computer
least
probably
generations
behind
times
competitive
nature
market
demanding
rate
development
so
your
timing
really
years
between
purchases
you
have
accept
limited
viability
whatever
architecture
you
buy
from
any
vendor
some
realities
about
computer
biz
we
all
have
live
keeping
customers
happy
most
important
so
don
give
