concerning
proposed
newsgroup
split
i
personally
am
favor
doing
i
learn
awful
lot
about
all
aspects
graphics
reading
group
from
code
hardware
algorithms
i
just
think
making
different
groups
out
wate
only
result
few
posts
week
per
group
i
kind
like
convenience
having
one
big
forum
discussing
all
aspects
graphics
anyone
else
feel
way
just
curious
i
disagree
you
could
learn
same
amount
reading
all
split
groups
would
make
things
easier
those
us
who
less
omnivorous
waste
creating
news
groups
its
just
bit
shuffling
about
i
have
problem
only
few
posts
per
week
per
group
i
spend
too
much
time
yes
shouldn
size
newsgroup
issue
sorry
has
been
covered
before
comp
grahpics
animation
get
how
much
traffic
per
day
articles
maybe
extremely
heavy
day
i
ve
been
following
group
about
four
months
now
i
don
recall
ever
seeing
flood
posts
split
would
warranted
just
my
cents
