my
three
d
library
does
lot
projections
duh
currently
projecting
object
vertices
per
triangle
basis
grossly
inefficient
objects
displayed
which
can
optimized
doing
projections
one
time
once
each
vertex
objects
whose
z
extents
intersect
hither
plane
can
benefit
from
because
new
vertices
must
created
during
z
clipping
anyone
have
any
better
ideas
yes
here
what
you
should
do
keep
vertices
array
have
polygons
triangles
okay
n
sided
polygons
slightly
more
efficient
store
indices
array
vertices
comprise
them
you
set
flag
each
vertex
when
you
transform
so
you
don
have
transform
any
vertex
more
than
once
you
also
do
backface
elimination
before
processing
polygon
so
vertices
belong
only
bacfacing
polys
don
have
transformed
all
whenever
you
transform
vertex
check
far
side
hither
plane
you
can
project
right
away
store
result
do
your
z
clip
any
vertices
get
produced
have
have
projection
done
