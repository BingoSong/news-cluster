concerning
proposed
newsgroup
split
i
personally
am
ch
favor
doing
i
learn
awful
lot
about
all
aspects
ch
graphics
reading
group
from
code
hardware
ch
algorithms
i
just
think
making
different
groups
out
ch
wate
only
result
few
posts
week
per
group
ch
i
kind
like
convenience
having
one
big
forum
ch
discussing
all
aspects
graphics
anyone
else
feel
way
ch
just
curious
i
must
agree
dizzying
number
c
amiga
newsgroups
already
addition
very
few
issues
which
fall
cleanly
one
categories
also
readily
observable
current
spectrum
amiga
groups
already
plagued
mega
crossposting
thus
group
split
would
all
likelihood
bring
about
more
structured
environment
