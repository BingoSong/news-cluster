ian
d
romanick
writes
what
kind
polygons
shaded
texturemapped
hm
more
comes
play
fast
routines
than
just
polygons
would
nice
know
exaclty
what
system
vga
start
what
processor
few
specifics
implementation
you
need
give
more
info
you
want
get
any
answers
p
i
don
want
texture
mapped
cause
i
did
i
d
asked
them
just
simple
fast
routine
do
filled
polygons
processor
d
minimum
maybe
i
can
find
good
one
ideally
i
want
polyn
function
can
clip
user
defined
viewport
write
arbitrary
location
memory
course
chances
finding
something
like
pretty
remote
so
i
guess
i
d
need
source
oh
i
guess
would
need
asm
otherwise
d
too
slow
i
ve
seen
some
polygon
routines
c
ve
all
been
waaay
too
slow
its
d
vector
graphics
program
i
ve
been
hunting
high
low
polyn
function
asm
i
can
find
one
anywhere
i
can
use
i
ve
found
one
two
polyn
functions
my
asm
pretty
bad
so
i
won
even
try
rewrite
them
