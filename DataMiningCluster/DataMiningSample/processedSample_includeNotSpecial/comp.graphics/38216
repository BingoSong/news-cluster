according
tiff
specification
tiff
version
number
bytes
has
been
chosen
its
deep
philosophical
significance
last
week
i
read
hitchhikers

number
i
m

i
read

tiff
spec
infuriates

i
m
none
too
happy
about
complexity
spec
anyway
because
i
think
arbitrary
carefully
chosen
number
neither
additionally
i
find
choice
bytes
begin
file
meaningless
themselves
why
just
use
letters
tiff
i
don
think
should
