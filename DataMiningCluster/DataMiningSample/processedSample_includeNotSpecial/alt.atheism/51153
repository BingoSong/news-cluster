i
am
strong
atheist
i
must
quibble
your
assertion
strong
position
requires
faith
i
believe
god
commonly
described
theists
exist
belief
merely
opinion
formed
basis
observation
including
certain
amount
introspection
i
fully
accept
i
could
wrong
swayed
suitably
convincing
evidence
thus
while
i
believe
gods
exist
does
imply
faith
my
part
so
let
me
first
say
believe
gods
exist
fact
different
than
believing
god
gods
i
argue
your
latter
statement
i
believe
gods
exist
does
rest
upon
faith
you
making
positive
statement
gods
exist
strong
atheism
rather
than
merely
saying
i
don
know
therefore
don
believe
them
don
believe
weak
atheism
once
again
believe
god
different
than
saying
i
believe
god
does
exist
i
still
maintain
position
even
after
reading
faqs
strong
atheism
requires
faith
first
let
me
say
following
we
might
have
language
problem
here
regards
faith
existence
i
christian
maintain
god
does
exist
exist
means
have
being
space
time
god
does
have
being
god
being
kierkegaard
once
said
god
does
exist
he
eternal
said
i
feel
rather
pointless
debate
so
called
existence
god
what
i
m
doing
here
i
believe
god
source
ground
being
when
you
say
god
does
exist
i
also
accept
statement
we
obviously
mean
two
different
things
however
what
follows
i
use
phrase
existence
god
usual
sense
sense
i
think
you
using
i
would
like
clarification
upon
what
you
mean
existence
god
we
also
might
differ
upon
what
means
have
faith
here
what
webster
says
faith
allegiance
duty
person
loyalty
b
fidelity
one
promises
sincerity
intentions
belief
trust
loyalty
god
belief
traditional
doctrines
religion
b
firm
belief
something
which
proof
complete
trust
something
believed
esp
strong
conviction
esp
system
religious
beliefs
syn
see
belief
one
can
never
prove
god
does
does
exist
when
you
say
you
believe
god
does
exist
opinion
based
upon
observation
i
have
ask
what
observtions
you
refering
observations
pro
con
valid
here
establishing
positive
belief
all
observations
can
only
point
you
direction
direction
we
might
even
predisposed
predisposed
i
mean
example
people
whoes
partents
believe
god
also
tend
actually
draw
conclusion
about
existence
non
existence
god
requires
leap
you
have
made
leap
when
you
actively
say
i
believe
god
does
does
exist
personally
i
think
both
statements
misguided
arguing
over
existence
god
precisely
wrong
way
find
him
yes
i
use
him
because
personal
god
only
viable
concept
imo
person
wants
use
she
go
ahead
course
god
neither
he
nor
she
we
have
choice
anthropomorphise
you
want
me
explain
myself
further
i
ll
glad
please
someone
does
agree
me
even
violently
disagree
ones
advantage
start
name
calling
person
thinks
i
ve
misunderstood
something
faqs
think
i
have
read
them
well
enough
just
point
out
me
error
my
ways
i
correct
situation
i
m
interested
polite
