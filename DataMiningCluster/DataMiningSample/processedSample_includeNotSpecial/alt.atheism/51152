subject
idle
questions
fellow
atheists
i
wonder
how
many
atheists
out
care
speculate
face
world
atheists
were
majority
rather
than
minority
group
population
rather
ridiculous
question
some
ways
i
know
my
newsreader
down
so
i
am
getting
any
new
postings
bit
so
i
figure
i
might
well
post
something
new
myself
also
how
many
atheists
out
would
actually
take
stance
accor
higher
value
way
thinking
over
theistic
way
thinking
typical
selfish
argument
would
both
lines
thinking
evolved
from
same
inherent
motivation
so
one
intrinsically
different
from
other
qualitatively
again
measuring
stick
must
drawn
somewhere
we
cannot
assign
value
system
beliefs
its
core
than
only
other
alternative
apply
its
periphery
ie
how
expresses
its
own
selfishness
idle
thoughts

often

weaklings
who
thought
themselves
good
simply
because
