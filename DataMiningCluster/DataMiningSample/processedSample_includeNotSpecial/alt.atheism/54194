have
you
noticed
philosophers
tend
atheists
atheists
agnostics
i
would
imagine
yes
my
point
atheist
would
theoretically
just
ill
equipped
study
philosophy
religion
christian
yet
persistence
atheists
among
ranks
philosophers
therefore
conflict
between
one
religious
beliefs
lack
thereof
ability
philosopher
must
great
you
assert

most
philosophers
may
non

secondary

careful
here
science
does
have
built
defence
against
faith
dogma
skepticism
unfortunately
foolproof
wonderful
little
creature
known
theory
many
us
believe
theory
evolution
we
have
absolute
proof
theory
true
so
why
do
we
believe
because
makes
more
sense
than
quite
bit
faith
involved
here
scientist
holds
sacred
idea
beliefs
should
change
suit
whatever
best
information
available
time
scientist
understands
any
current
beliefs
deficient
some
way
well
all
current
beliefs
deficient
basically
i
agree
can
you
see
difference
science
views
beliefs
being
flawed
new
information
can
obtained
improve
them
ideally
true
reality
though
you
have
acknowledge
scientists
human
scientists
have
egos
biases
some
scientists
assume
particular
theory
true
refuse
admit
flaws
theory
because
ego
problems
whatever
proceed
spend
time
money
trying
come
up
absolute
proof
theory
remember
cold
fusion
way
i
wasn
aware
mass
suicide
problem
waco
jonestown
were
isolated
incidents
mass
suicides
far
from
common
clinton
fbi
would
love
you
convince
them
would
save
us
taxpayer
lot
money
you
could
really
i
agree
we
spent
far
too
much
money
waco
crisis
i
believe
especially
considering
outcome
my
point
mass
suicides
u
rare
jonestown
guyana
incidentally
although
we
footed
bill
clean
up
u
has
far
more
important
issues
address
compare
number
u
citizens
who
have
died
mass
suicides
say
number
u
soldiers
who
died
during
one
week
vietnam
war
