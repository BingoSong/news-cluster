atheism
denies
existence
god
logically
bankrupt
where
proof
nonexistence
joke
one
my
favorite
fallacious
points
against
atheism
i
e
belief
you
can
deny
anything
you
can
prove
doesn
exist
easily
nailed
showing
infinite
number
beings
conceivable
observed
exist
does
mean
we
would
have
believe
all
them
according
above
poster
we
must
believe
objects
beings
haven
been
proved
exist
so
why
stop
god
could
huge
number
beings
identical
ronald
reagan
except
trivial
differences
say
one
missing
finger
one
has
blond
hair
all
live
other
planets
so
we
can
see
them
reason
one
atheists
bring
up
none
christians
have
vested
interest
unknown
beings
exception
god
fine
why
do
people
shoot
themselves
foot
mock
idea
god
here
again
classic
atheist
fallacy
how
did
shoot
themselves
foot
radical
muslims
crusades
inquisition
common
examples
atheists
like
bring
up
marks
against
religion
how
weak
only
fools
can
take
drivel
seriously
how
about
grand
daddy
all
human
atrocities
stalinist
movement
twenty
eight
million
people
killed
under
leadership
which
proudly
featured
atheism
big
difference
here
stalin
didn
say
he
stood
particular
moral
position
i
e
against
murder
terrorism
etc
did
opposite
like
religious
movements
he
least
honest
killer
support
stalin
attack
viewpoint
saying
atheism
supports
murder
violence
just
because
one
man
tyrant
atheist
just
bad
logic
look
all
russians
helped
stalin
weren
atheists
don
contradict
your
point
besides
your
point
assumes
his
atheism
relevant
his
murdering
people
just
common
assumption
atheists
can
value
life
much
theists
which
you
didn
support
agnostics
funny
because
more
reasonable
yet
do
some
sense
seem
funny
because
believe
existence
god
unknowable
itself
every
bit
assumption
atheism
though
less
arrogant
pompous
ah
here
another
point
you
didn
get
out
faq
atheist
doesn
have
hold
positive
view
god
doesn
exist
he
she
may
just
have
non
existence
positive
belief
here
example
strong
atheism
i
believe
god
does
exist
positive
belief
weak
atheism
i
don
believe
god
negative
belief
same
some
one
has
never
thought
idea
god
whole
life
technically
atheist
kind
you
calling
unreasonable
let
look
way
sets
suppose
given
person
has
huge
set
ideas
i
represent
capital
letters
people
either
believe
ideas
exist
real
objects
so
santa
e
person
believing
santa
still
having
idea
santa
notice
even
e
itself
another
