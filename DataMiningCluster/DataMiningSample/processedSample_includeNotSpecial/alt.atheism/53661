add
outrageous
cost
putting
someone
death
special
cell
block
years
court
costs
extra
guards
benefits
death
penalty
entirely
disappear
because
your
earlier
claim
one
innocent
death
overrides
benefit
all
others
obviously
tragic
argument
doing
away
death
penalty
we
went
war
worried
about
accidentally
killing
civilians
all
time
because
our
determination
who
enemy
really
imperfect
way
win
war
yes
fortunately
we
have
right
thinking
folks
like
your
good
self
power
therefore
deemed
acceptable
slaughter
tens
even
hundreds
thousands
iraqis
order
liberate
oil
h
h
hkuwait
we
won
war
hurrah
hurrah
number
civilian
iraqi
deaths
were
way
over
exaggerated
exploited
anti
war
emotionalism
liberal
news
media
facts
less
iraqis
died
gulf
war
than
did
civilians
any
other
war
comparable
size
century
due
mostly
short
duration
coupled
precise
surgical
bombing
techniques
which
were
technically
possible
only
recently
idea
hundreds
thousands
iraqi
citizens
died
ludicrous
even
hundreds
thousands
iraqi
soldiers
died
were
ones
being
targeted
do
you
think
us
its
allies
were
specifically
out
kill
maim
iraqi
civilians
either
smart
bombs
didn
hit
targets
we
know
did
were
targeting
civilian
targets
which
hardly
condusive
destroying
iraq
military
potential
military
mission
planners
fools
know
have
hit
military
targets
win
war
hitting
civilian
targets
does
nothing
unite
people
against
you
laudable
goal
one
wants
people
rise
up
against
tyrant
dictator
ok
so
some
innocent
people
died
yes
maybe
unarmed
civilians
fleeing
along
road
didn
need
bombed
bits
perhaps
kid
half
his
face
burned
off
little
girl
mangled
legs
weren
entirely
guilty
worth
death
few
innocents
save
oil
h
h
hlives
kuwaiti
people
isn
after
all
iraqis
may
have
had
chance
vote
saddam
showed
acceptance
his
regime
assassinating
him
right
all
surrendering
fleeing
along
open
roads
just
devious
ploy
we
were
entirely
within
our
rights
bomb
em
just
case
without
finding
out
were
soldiers
how
about
all
innocent
people
who
died
blanket
bombing
ww
i
don
hear
you
bemoaning
them
war
never
exact
science
smart
bombs
becoming
more
exact
smaller
percentage
civilian
casualties
sometimes
mistakes
made
targets
misidentified
innocents
die
war
way
really
alternative
allow
tyrannical
dictators
treat
earth
like
one
big
rummage
sale
grabbing
everything
can
get
worse
like
patrick
henry
said
some
years
ago
i
know
what
course
others
may
take
me
give
me
liberty
give
me
death
war
always
price
one
must
willing
pay
one
wishes
stay
free
death
penalty
conceived
deterrent
crime
legal
shenanigans
have
been
added
automatic
appeals
lengthy
court
battles
etc
have
relegated
purpose
very
small
part
what
should
hence
question
do
we
instate
death
penalty
meant
see
deters
crime
do
we
get
rid
entirely
yes
let
reinstate
death
penalty
way
ought
all
shit
about
fair
trials
court
appeals
just
gets
way
justice
let
give
police
absolute
right
gun
down
guilty
save
ourselves
expense
all
those
lawyers
think
knock
benefits
too
la
would
never
have
had
spend
so
much
money
cleaning
up
after
riots
holding
showcase
trials
cops
had
been
allowed
do
job
properly
quick
bullet
through
head
rodney
king
another
cameraman
everyone
would
have
been
saved
great
deal
unnecessary
paperwork
expense
after
all
police
decide
man
guilty
ought
enough
fact
death
penalty
has
been
shown
have
any
deterrent
effect
over
imprisonment
well
entirely
irrelevant
mathew
mathew
your
sarcasm
noted
you
completely
off
base
here
you
come
off
sounding
like
complete
peace
nik
idiot
although
i
feel
sure
your
intent
so
iraqi
war
wrong
eh
i
m
sure
appeasement
would
have
worked
better
than
war
just
like
did
ww
eh
i
guess
we
shouldn
have
fought
ww
either
just
think
all
those
innocent
german
civilians
killed
dresden
hamburg
how
about
all
poor
french
who
died
crossfire
because
we
invaded
continent
we
should
have
just
let
hitler
take
over
europe
you
d
speaking
german
instead
english
right
now
tyrants
like
hussein
have
stopped
his
kind
don
understand
diplomacy
only
understand
point
gun
my
only
regret
bush
wimped
out
didn
have
military
roll
baghdad
so
now
hussein
still
power
iraqi
people
sacrifice
mention
americans
who
died
naught
liberating
kuwait
good
thing
wiping
hussein
off
map
would
ve
been
better
poor
poor
rodney
king
did
you
ever
stop
think
why
jury
first
trial
brought
back
verdict
guilty
those
who
have
been
foaming
mouth
blood
those
policemen
certainly
have
looked
further
than
video
tape
jury
looked
all
evidence
evidence
which
you
i
have
seen
when
one
makes
judgment
without
benefit
trial
where
evidence
can
presented
both
sides
one
has
simply
lowered
himself
level
vigilante
justice
state
mind
which
your
sarcasm
above
seemingly
spoke
against
instead
tends
support
case
against
policemen
law
country
intended
protect
rights
accused
whether
criminals
cops
one
found
guilty
reasonable
doubt
one
guilt
only
jury
position
assess
evidence
render
verdict
anyone
else
simply
succumbing
verbal
vigilantism
