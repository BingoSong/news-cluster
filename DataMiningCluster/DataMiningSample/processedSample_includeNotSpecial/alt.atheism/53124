first
i
want
start
right
out
say
i
m
christian
makes
sense
one
have
any
you
read
tony
campollo
book
liar
lunatic
real
thing
i
might
little
off
title
he
writes
book
anyway
he
part
effort
destroy
christianity
process
he
became
christian
himself
converts
xtianity
have
tendency
excessively
darken
pre
xtian
past
frequently
falsely
anyone
who
embarks
effort
destroy
xtianity
suffering
from
deep
megalomania
defect
which
cured
religious
conversion
arguements
he
uses
i
am
summing
up
book
about
whether
jesus
god
i
know
many
you
don
believe
listen
different
perspective
we
all
have
something
gain
listening
what
others
have
say
different
perspective
different
perspective
bwahahahahahahahah
book
says
jesus
either
liar
he
crazy
modern
day
koresh
he
actually
who
he
said
he
sigh
perhaps
big
j
just
mistaken
about
some
his
claims
perhaps
he
normally
insightful
had
few
off
days
perhaps
many
most
statements
attributed
jesus
were
made
him
were
put
his
mouth
later
authors
other
possibilities
abound
surely
someone
seriously
examining
question
could
come
up
decent
list
possible
alternatives
unless
task
serious
examination
question
much
less
destroying
xtianity
rather
religious
salesmanship
some
reasons
why
he
wouldn
liar
follows
who
would
die
lie
how
many
germans
died
nazism
how
many
russians
died
name
proletarian
dictatorship
how
many
americans
died
make
world
safe
democracy
what
silly
question
wouldn
people
able
tell
he
liar
people
gathered
around
him
kept
doing
many
gathered
from
hearing
seeing
someone
who
had
been
healed
call
me
fool
i
believe
he
did
heal
people
everyone
who
performs
healing
god
niether
he
lunatic
would
more
than
entire
nation
drawn
someone
who
crazy
probably
hard
draw
entire
nation
you
unless
you
crazy
very
doubtful
fact
rediculous
example
anyone
who
drawn
david
koresh
obviously
fool
logical
people
see
right
away
therefore
since
he
wasn
liar
lunatic
he
must
have
been
real
thing
anyone
who
convinced
laughable
logic
deserves
xtian
some
other
things
note
he
fulfilled
loads
prophecies
psalms
isaiah
elsewhere
hrs
alone
his
betrayal
crucifixion
i
don
have
my
bible
me
moment
next
time
i
write
i
use
don
bother
many
prophecies
were
fulfilled
only
eyes
xtian
apologists
who
distort
meaning
isaiah
other
ot
books
