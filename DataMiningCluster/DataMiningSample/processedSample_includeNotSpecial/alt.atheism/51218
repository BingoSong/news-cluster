perhaps
we
shouldn
imprision
people
we
could
watch
them
closely
instead
cost
would
probably
similar
especially
we
just
implanted
some
sort
electronic
device
why
wait
until
commit
crime
why
implant
devices
potential
criminals
like
communists
atheists
sorry
i
don
follow
your
reasoning
you
proposing
punish
people
before
commit
crime
what
justification
do
you
have
mathew
proposing
public
defence
mechanism
treating
electronic
device
impropriety
wearer
what
he
saying
next
step
beyond
what
you
propose
permanent
bugging
potential
criminals
may
surface
sound
like
bad
thing
who
defines
what
potential
criminal
government
day
decides
being
member
opposition
party
makes
you
potential
criminal
openly
defying
government
becomes
lethal
practice
conducive
free
society
mathew
saying
implanting
electronic
surveillance
devices
upon
people
impropriety
upon
person
regardless
what
type
crime
what
chance
recidivism
basically
you
see
criminal
justice
system
punishment
offender
possibly
therefore
deterrant
future
offenders
mathew
sees
most
probably
means
rehabilitation
offender
so
he
being
cynical
you
okay
