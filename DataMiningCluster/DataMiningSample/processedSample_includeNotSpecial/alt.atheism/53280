yet
i
am
still
believer
god
concerned
my
disposition
why
beneath
him
provide
me
evidence
i
would
require
believe
evidence
my
personality
given
me
god
would
find
compelling
fact
god
could
cause
you
believe
anything
he
wants
you
think
about
minute
would
you
rather
have
someone
love
you
because
you
made
them
love
you
because
wanted
love
you
first
i
don
expect
them
love
me
don
even
know
i
exist
secondly
i
wouldn
expect
them
love
me
simply
because
were
my
creator
i
would
expect
have
earn
love
responsibility
you
love
god
take
step
toward
him
he
promises
you
you
have
look
yourself
you
daft
how
do
i
love
something
i
don
believe
exists
come
back
when
you
ve
learned
love
your
third
testicle
those
who
doubt
dispute
have
givin
sincere
effort
simple
logic
arguments
folly
you
read
bible
you
see
jesus
made
fools
those
who
tried
trick
him
logic
our
ability
reason
just
spec
creation
yet
some
think
ultimate
you
rely
simply
your
reason
you
never
know
more
than
you
do
now
learn
you
must
accept
which
you
don
know
which
point
you
have
stepped
over
line
become
complete
asshole
even
though
your
first
offense
i
won
let
slip
becuase
i
ve
heard
too
goddamned
many
times
you
love
jesus
because
deep
your
heart
you
re
cannibalistic
necrophiliac
because
i
say
so
i
m
much
more
qualified
assess
your
motivations
than
you
fortunately
some
things
i
get
accept
evidence
rather
than
faith
one
them
being
until
christians
like
yourself
quit
being
so
fucking
arrogant
never
peace
you
ve
all
made
sure
