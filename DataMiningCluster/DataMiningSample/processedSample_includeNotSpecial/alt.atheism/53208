agree
bobby
far
religion
used
kill
large
numbers
people
usually
used
form
manner
originally
intended
doesn
reduce
number
deaths
directly
caused
religion
just
minor
observation
fact
almost
nothing
pure
universe
very
act
honestly
attempting
find
true
meaning
religious
teaching
has
many
times
inspired
hatred
led
war
many
people
have
been
led
religious
leaders
more
involved
own
stomache
contentsthan
any
absolute
truth
have
therefore
been
driven
kill
leaders
point
many
things
involved
religion
often
lead
war
whether

unpleasant
side

bobby
would
have
result
people
switching
between

spontaneously
results

just
show
how
true
two
groups
very
clear
specific
ideologies
using
religious
persecution
further
means
anyone
who
cannot
see
obvious
namely
were
groups
founded
reasons
entirely
own
who
used
religious
persecution
because
any
belief
system
because
made

more
powerfull
trying

hard
basically
bobby
uses
examples
because
so
