some
society
came
up
good
reason
why
rape
murder
ok
i
would
consistent
my
position
hold
still
wrong
my
basis
morality
societal
norms
current
legalities
my
basis
surprise
surprise
both
bible
inherent
moral
abhorrences
ah
what
exactly
inherently
abhorrent
why
so
what
you
re
saying
effect
i
think
some
things
repulsive
i
know
whole
bunch
other
people
who
agree
me
so
should
deemed
absolutely
immoral
now
forever
period
which
itself
nice
enough
some
extent
i
agree
you
i
do
agree
things
inherently
absolutely
immoral
labeled
immoral
each
its
own
good
reason
reason
can
even
theoretically
change
so
can
label
yes
vague
only
way
i
know
off
top
my
head
defend
say
all
humans
similarly
made
yes
falls
trap
creation
doesn
humans
some
extent
similar
because
we
all
belong
same
species
species
has
evolved
another
story
altogether
certain
extent
evolution
can
even
lend
credence
moral
absolutism
flavour
my
arguments
better
exhibit
trust
goodness
love
respect
courage
honesty
any
society
rather
than
deceipt
hatred
disrespect
cowardness
dishonesty
you
re
saying
morality
what
ll
keep
society
alive
kicking
i
think
up
point
societies
all
alike
neither
moralities
i
haven
been
everywhere
seen
everyone
according
my
thesis
i
don
have
since
i
hold
we
were
all
created
similarly
similar
identical
makes
unfalsifiable
thesis
just
say
so
i
ll
both
work
out
what
i
can
punt
fellow
theists
falsifiable
through
finding
someoe
who
created
different
whatever
might
