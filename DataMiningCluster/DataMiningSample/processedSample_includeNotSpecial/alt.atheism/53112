i
m
going

gives
me
reason
believe
god
i
absolutely
can

while
ago
i
read
interesting
book
fellow
called
von
daenicken
which
he
proved
some
wildest
things
last
page
he
wrote
something
like
can
you
prove
isn
so
i
certainly
can
i
m
going
believe
him
because
he
based
his
proof
some
really
questionable
stuff
old
myths
he
called
circumstancial
evidence
so
far
atheism
hasn
made
