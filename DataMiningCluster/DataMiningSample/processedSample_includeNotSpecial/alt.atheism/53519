considering

judging
according

look
its
claims
fulfilling
earlier

perhaps
most
eager
draw
out
what
he
thinks
prophetic
answers
career
jesus
nazareth
you
see
matthew
main
strategy
take
various
old
testament
passages
often
even
about
promised
messiah
apply
them
circumstances
new
testament
we
must
also
bear
mind
question
authenticity
accounts
since
gospels
were
written
least
years
after
jesus
executed
we
do
know
how
much
happened
exactly
stated

we
take
particular
claims

value
immanuel
we
begin
course
beginning
mt
mary
bear

christianity
wished

jesus
becomes

second

too
convincing

after

matthew
tells
about

he
wishes

done

fulfil
what

matthew
conveniently
omits

hosea
oracle
indeed
israel
once
called
out

wanted
return
history
jesus
certainly
being
spoken
here
we
draw
some
kind
parallel
here
we
wind
up
jesus
flees
resists
g

prophecy
just
convincing
matthew
probably
had
hoped
rachel
weeps
while
jesus
off
vacationing

matthew
says
king
herod
sought
kill
him
thus
ordered
executions
all
young

writes
mt

can

obviously
matthew

jesus
next
goes
around

few

skewed
fit

we
have
surely

jesus
we

here
isaiah
prophecy
something
come
rather
something
had
already
happened
while
believed
jesus
took
eternal
punishment
hell
he
did
bear
illnesses
he
healed
so
while
someone
might
want
say
figuratively
jesus
reenacted

israel
his

atonement
he
has
admit
matthew
parallel
misses
where
he
intended
have
its
effect
silent
messiah
upon
healing
multitudes
commoners
said
jesus
ordered
them
keep
quiet
presumable
so
he
wouldn
arouse
attention
local
rulers
mt
fulfill
what
spoken
prophet
isaiah
behold
my
servant
whom
i
have
chosen
my
beloved
whom
my
soul
pleased
i
put
my
spirit
him
he
announce

gentiles
he
wrangle
cry
aloud
nor
anyone
hear

he
break

discouraged
bruised
until

has
established

earth
coastlands
await
his
law
you
see
matthew
has
conveniently
left
out
part
passage
because
does
suit
dealings
jesus
christians
could
never
think
jesus
failing
never
would
light
mankind
burn
dimly
servant

israel
indeed
come
end
when
its
job
done
when
gentiles
come
embrace
g
d
longer
chosen

rather
all
children
g
d
also
ending
phrase
has
been
changed
from
judaic
coastlands
await
his
law
christologic
gentiles
hope
his
name
while
original
proclaims
torah
law
jehovah
other
rewrites
fit
its
strange
doctrine
believing
name
one
has
any
doubt
servant
referred
jesus
one
has
only
read
whole
chapter
isaiah
hear
about
beloved
blind
imperfect
servant
people
robbed
plundered
so
we
see
when
matthew
attempt
prophecy
examined
crumbles
three
days
three
nights
now
we
come
upon
prophecy
supposedly
uttered
very
mouth
god
jesus
himself
he
speaks
his
crucifixion
resurrection
mt
jonah
belly
whale
three
days
three
nights
so
son
man
heart
earth
three
days
three
nights
before
any
further
discussion
can
occur
necessary
know
how
jews
understood
days
far
day
names
went
each
hours
long
lasting
from
sunset
pm
following

pm
what
referred

from
am
ending
sunset
pm
thus
according
our
time
scale
sabbath
day
began
pm
friday
evening
lasted
until

saturday
evening
why
jews
celebrate
sabbath
daylight
portion
saturdays
instead
sundays
seems
like
real
miracle
christians
didn
forget
saturday
indeed
seventh
last
day
week
thus
when
days
nights
referred
together
hour
daylight
portions
hour
night
periods
being
spoken
thus
jesus
says
he
grave
hell
otherwise
unresurrected
three
days
three
nights
good
book
tells
us
jesus
crucified
ninth
hour
which
pm
friday
afternoon
he
put
grave
sometime
after
jesus
left
grave
rose
before
dawn
what
we
call
sunday
dawn
after

over
what
means
jesus
using
our
time
clarity
grave
from
pm
friday
night
some
time
before
am
sunday
morning
we
could
also
add
little
time
before
pm
friday
since
bible
specific
here
what
means
using
jewish
time
he
grave
one
day
two
nights
possibly
couple
hours
one

certainly
problem
jesus
prediction
absolutely
way
we
even
able
have
his
death
involve
three
days
three
nights
even
using
modern
time
measurements
we
led
suspect
error
another
one
matthew
little
mistakes
gospel
writer
put
false
words
his
god
mouth
matter
who
made
prediction
more
than
unconvincing
counter
convincing
hearing

tool

speaking
his
vast
audiences
parables

which
deeper
meaning
could
found
you
were

elect
those
chosen
understand

jesus
he
reasons
those
who
can
understand
parables
ones
he
wants
people
cannot
understand
them
need
bother
them
since
accept
plain
message
any
better
matthew
says
mt
them
audience
indeed
fulfilled
prophecy
isaiah
which
says
you
indeed
hear
never
understand
you
indeed

never
perceive
because
people

matthew
has
cut

just

suit
his
own

needs
more
than
he
has
altered
words
make
fit
people
who
didn

jesus
stories
we
see
isaiah
verses
prophecies
rather
commands
from
g
d
him
present
once
again
matthew
prophecy
falls
flat
its
face
matthew
tries
again
make
jesus
parables
look
like
have
prophetic
approval
mt
he
said
nothing
them
without
parable
fulfil
what
spoken
prophet
i
open
my
mouth
them
parables
i
utter
which
has
been
hidden
since
foundation

matthew
really
botches
up
here
he
attempts
quote
from
prophet
from
psalms
ps
i
open
my
mouth
parable
i
utter
dark
sayings
old
things
we
all
have
heard

our

have
told
us
we
hide
them
from
children
tell
coming
generation
glorious
deeds
lord
pointed
out
verses
psalms
do
really
come
from
prophet
you
might
also
want
know
earlier
copies
matthew
gospel
even
inserted
isaiah
name
prophet
apparently
later
scribes
caught
error
tried
cover
some
up
perhaps
most
significant
part
once
again
matthew
has
altered
old
testament
scriptures
jesus
has
said
earlier
he
speaks
parables
so
some
understand
them
parables
psalms
hidden
further
speak
things
known
our

have
told
us
jesus
deals
things
hidden
since
foundation

indeed
jesus
dealt
lot
secrecy
confusion
direct
opposition
parables

wonder
matthew
had
rewrite
them
still
once
again
matthew
artificial
prophecies
fall
flat
face
christians
rarely
look
matthew
prophecies
aren
only
things
about
christianity
beginning
look
bad
excuses
little
faith
mt
we
see
disciples
able
go
around
casting
out
demons
except
one
case
knowing
what
epilepsy
people
thought
those
disease
were
possesed
demons
wonder
disciples
were
unable
dispossess
epileptic
jesus
perhaps
more
enlightened
than
reported
have
rebuked
them
saying
didn
have
enough
faith
seems
strange
why
demon
special
seems
either
true
believer
has

he
does
apparently
enough

allow
someone
move

you

does

sometimes

only
because
everybody
has
little

jesus
rides

shortly
after
accepting

jewish
messiah
king
jesus
requests
donkey
brought
him
ride
jerusalem
mt
took

fulfil
what
spoken
prophet
saying
tell
daughter
zion
behold
your
king
coming
you
humble
mounted
ass
ass
colt
course
passage
quoted
from
zechariah
reads
little
differently
lo
your
king
comes
you
he
triumphant
victorious
humble
riding
ass
ass
colt
he
command
peace
nations
isn
all
much
difference
here
except
zechariah
only
involves
one
animal
ass
colt
while
matthew
reads
poetic
wording
slightly
differently
thus
he
has
jesus
call
both
colt
adult
ass
from
matthew
version
we
get
comical
picture
divine
christ
sweating
straddle
two
donkeys
could
inevitably
lead
theological
proctological
dilemma
we
find
account
written
earlier
st
mark
only
colt
called
brought
jesus
indeed
fits
verses
zechariah
properly
shows
us
matthew
attempt
use
prophetic
verses
he
has
bungled
now
excluding
many
respectable
christians
i
have
met
i
have
noticed
while
christ
thought
have
ridden
asses
situation
often
reversed
nowadays
entering
jerusalem
temple
priests
were
angered
people
youngsters
calling
jesus
messiah
jesus
replied
we
might
expect
matthew
have
done
mt
haven
you
read
out
mouth
babes
sucklings
thou
has
brought
perfect
praise
more
likely
matthew
made
response
up
since
jesus
never
one
point
out
little
prophetic
things
since
we
might
expect
quote
error
which
seems
fit
matthew
track
record
quite
well

majestic
your

you

see
why

we
need
only
look

about
messiah
see
he
expected
great
king
bringing
jews
times
even
better
than
those
under

jews

who
thought

psalm
quoted
about

his
political
military
enemies
about

surprising
we
run
further
problem
when
we
see
jesus
psalm
asks
g
d
damnation
crucifiers
whereas
jesus
gospels
says
lk
jesus
said
father
forgive

matthew
misses
his
attempt
create
prophecy
having

bitter
substance
put
jesus

his

psalm
stipulates
prophecy
vinegar
faulty
we
naturally
ask
what
casting
lots
brings
up
nd
psalm
which
deserves
discussion
all
itself
suffice
now
say
fact
jesus
clothes
were
divided
told
great
thing
turns
out
happened
often
any
felon
those
days
we
soon
see
perhaps
least
erroneous
passage
psalm
when
applied
jesus
does
indeed
bring
up
interesting
question
quality
jesus
clothes
man
so
removed
from
worldly
possessions
his
ownership
clothes
worthy
casting
lots
raises
some
suspicions
nd
psalm
psalm
attributed
david
lament
his
condition
under
attack
his
enemies
becomes
song
praise
yhvh
hope
taken
out
context
parts
seem
fit
plight
jesus
crucifixion
quite
well
we
examine
primary
passages
verse
my
god
my
god
why
have
you
forsaken
me
why
you
so
far
from
helping
me
far
from
words
my
groaning
oh
my
god
i
cry
day
you
don
answer
night
find
rest
jesus
said
have
cried
first
sentence
while
cross
suggests
whole
psalm
really
about
jesus
rather
than
king
david
course
rest
first
stanza
does
fit
nicely
jesus
his
execution
jesus
pictured
complaining
about
whole
ordeal
he
supposed
like
lamb
led
mute
before
its
shearers
indeed
jesus
doesn
do
much
groaning
even
when
cross
he
certainly
does
cry
both
day
night
cross
i
am
worm
man
scorned
men
all
who
see
me
mock
me
make
faces
wag
heads
he
committed
his
cause
yhvh
so
let
him
deliver
him
he
delights

pretty
well
exception
holy

my

would
seem
quite
convincing
i
m
sure
early
christian

who

thought
so
too
unfortunately

has
fatal
flaw
words

artificial
weight

just
what
christian
translators
have
chosen
do
while
correct
translation
does
eliminate
psalm
from
referring
jesus
its
absence
does
say
much
honesty
translators
apart
from
erroneous
verse
psalm
does
lend
itself
jesus
so
easily
verse
speaks
sufferer
being
saved
from
sword
rather
than
cross
naturally
fits
psalm
true
subject
king
david
side
note
we
now
know
crucifixions
did
pierce
hands
palms
rather
forearms
doesn
say
much
favour
traditional
thought
resurrected
jesus
showing
his
disciples
scars
his
palms
facts
aren
bound
our
religious
beliefs
matthew
escapes
culpability
time
he
does
attempt
draw
many
direct
links
between

lord
jesus
psalm
like
many
others
minds
all
gospel
writers
when
compiled

interpretations
jesus
life
death
how
much
scriptures
may
have
contributed
what
actually
got
written
down
question
has
serious
repercussions
christian
theology
easy
see
those
who
faithful
fundamentalists
how
some
events
new
testament
might
have
been
enhanced
scribes
eager
matthew
does
less
speculate
than
simply
investigate
scriptural
matters
prophetic
claims
so
far
has
said
good
things
st
matthew
reference
piercing
looks
lot
like
jesus
crucifixion
john
gospel
recount
written
about
years
after
fact
tells
us
jesus

jn
one
soldiers
pierced
his
side
spear
out
came
blood
water
things
took

scripture
fulfilled
look
him
whom
ve
pierced
course
built
passage
taken
blatantly
out

prophet
zechariah
tells
us
how
much

judah
day
i

so
when
look
him
who
have

mourn
weep
bitterly
over
him
like
you
weep
over
firstborn

john
attempt
make
up

perhaps
weaker
matthew
attempts
matthew

usually
excontexts
more
than
just
one
passage
john
errors
grossly
obvious
blatant
here
does
speak
well
any
gospel
writers
helps
show
how
prophetic
aspects
religion
were
founded
reckoned
transgressors
after
his
arrest
jesus
quickly
executed
claiming
jewish
kingship
messiahship
according
one
version
gospel
tale
jesus
gets
executed
along
two
thieves
mk
him
crucified
two
robbers
one
his
right
one
his
left
so
scripture
fulfilled
which
says
he
reckoned
transgressors
here
mark
trying
link
jesus
passage
isaiah
about
servant
nation
israel
passage
about
messiah
one
reads
whole
chapter
isaiah
its
surrounding
chapters
one
sees

verses
also
about
what
servant
has
gone
through
past
prediction
what
come
any
event
servant
thought
criminal
also
happens
fit
description
jesus
had
passage
really
been
about
messiah
still
all
clear
why
executing
jesus
between
two
thieves
would
fulfill
prophecy
isaiah
jesus
would
more
fittingly
fulfill
his
whole
ministry
he
considered
blasphemer
troublemaker
all
throughout
his
career
locking
onto
single
event
rather
poor
way
steal
prophecy
least
case
we
see
mark
could
have
had
made
better
analogy
general
comparisons
mark
goes
tell
us
how
those
who
were

jesus
also
reviled
him
expected
from
couple
robbers
course
his

recount
st

decides
change
some

luke
tells
us
lk
one

who

aren
you

certainly
fits

which
tells
how
people
who
crucified

said
save
yourself
robbers
did

luke
goes
other

rebuked

don

since

condemnation
we
indeed
justly
so
we

he
said
jesus
remember

jesus
answered
verily
i

you

paradise
now
little

seems
highly
contrived
stretches
imagination
bit
see
picture
one
ruffian
rebuking
his

eloquent

we
have
rather
strange
picture
criminal
lamenting
over
goodness
his
punishment
justness
his
suffering
man
apparently
noble
principle
doesn

likely

we
wonder
amount
theatrics
created

course
luke
recount
also
disagrees
mark
luke
has
only

because

free

open
yet
another
example
writer
trying

old

passage
expand
reinterpret

his
theology
case
embroidery
creates
some
embarrassing
problems
we
have
seen
end

mt
now
comes
perhaps
one
most
extraordinary
embarrassing
passages
new
testament
found
all
three
synoptic
gospel
stories
casts
some
most
unfavourable
doubt
whole
theory
christianity
jesus
mentions
destruction
jewish
temples
buildings
his
disciples
ask
him
about
about
end
world
which
he
has
been
warning
about
disciples
tell
us
when
temple
destruction
what
sign
your
coming
close
age
jesus
take

one
leads
you
astray
many
come
my

i

you
hear

false

he
who

so
when
you

those
who

immediately
after

those

you

one

therefore
you
also
must

you
do
expect
from

jesus
thought

would
within
lifetimes
least
some
his

he
tells

although
he
doesn
know
exact
day
hour
come
thus
must
ready
theologians
have
wet
pants
panic
find
some
way
out
holy
error
unfortunately
jesus
made
himself
explicit
he
told
his
disciples
generation
would
still
around
end
particular
should
prepare
prepare
swept
away
have
been
some
who
resorted
removing
inerrant
nature
bible

phrase
generation
shall

really
means
race
people
pass
away
course
word
generation
used
many
times
refer
exactly
generation
disciples
interesting
notion
when
god
decided
learn
greek
he
didn
learn
well
enough
make
himself
clear
quite
obvious
from
rest
dialogue
disciples
least
some

supposed
live
end

charge
mistranslation
completely
blown
away
looking

responses
becomes
abundantly
clear
from

what

have
rationalised

he
must
all
we
must
do
wait
can
you
imagine
how
tired
he
must
sitting
around
up
being
holy
waiting
just
right
moment
spring
so
shortly
after
his
crucifixion
jesus
nazareth
joshua
ben
joseph
died
said
after
three
days
three
days
three
nights
three
periods
time
three
eternal
seconds
three
whatever
can
decide
makes
less
trouble
he
seen
again
resurrected
glowing
divine
radiance
saviour
decided
wasn
best
interests
his
new
religion
stick
around
therefore
disappeared
from
sight
heaven
so
story
goes
anyway
has
been
seen
were
many
things
attributed
jesus
when
people
got
around
writing
gospel
stories
down
them
jesus
fulfiller
all
prophecy
scripture
we
have
seen
though
matter
quite
shaky
throughout
church
history
christians
have
held
fast
faith
simple
belief
what
doctrinal
objections
could
solved
argumentation
brute
force
faith
forgetfulness
kept
away
from
question
question
investigate
has
never
been
easiest
way
treat
matters
thus
years
prophecies
cited
new
testament
have
gone
largely
accepted
things
may
well
continue
way
some
time
pausing
moment
consider
way
doctrines
christianity
have
been
accepted
used
properly
improperly
support
wars
persecution
i
suppose
one
prophecy
which
christianity
can
securely
keep
hold
mt
jesus
don
think
i
have
come
bring
peace
earth
i
haven
come
bring
peace
rather
sword
