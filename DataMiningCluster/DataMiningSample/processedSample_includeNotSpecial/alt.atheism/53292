yes
fortunately
we
have
right
thinking
folks
like
your
good
self
power
therefore
deemed
acceptable
slaughter
tens
even
hundreds
o
thousands
iraqis
order
liberate
oil
h
h
hkuwait
we
won
war
hurrah
hurrah
number
civilian
iraqi
deaths
were
way
over
exaggerated
exploited
anti
war
emotionalism
liberal
news
media
facts
less
iraqis
died
gulf
war
than
did
civilians
any
other
war
comparable
size
century
let
analyze
claim
little
how
size
war
defined
number
participants
geographical
area
number
countries
involved
number
casualties
size
armies
duration
numbers
casualties
both
absolute
percentage
those
involved
geographical
area
numbers
countries
too
all
measures
size
case
i
d
say
relevant
statistic
would
number
combatants
total
troops
compared
total
casualties
from
among
total
civilian
population
affected
geographical
area
which
other
comparable
wars
we
talking
about
vietnam
korea
might
make
good
comparisons
which
liberal
news
media
we
talking
about
western
news
general
particular
american
mass
media
cbs
nbc
abc
etc
general
tone
news
during
whole
war
one
those
poor
poor
iraqis
along
look
how
precisely
cruise
missile
blew
building
bits
due
mostly
short
duration
coupled
precise
surgical
bombing
techniques
which
were
technically
possible
only
recently
i
suspect
medical
advances
may
have
something
do
too
i
agree
how
about
all
innocent
people
who
died
blanket
bombing
ww
i
don
hear
you
bemoaning
them
perhaps
because
topic
hasn
cropped
up
you
want
my
opinion
i
think
blanket
bombing
german
cities
end
world
war
two
most
appalling
act
wholesale
slaughter
country
has
committed
centuries
bomber
harris
hero
mine
perhaps
so
maybe
atomic
bomb
mistake
too
easy
say
from
our
enlightened
viewpoint
here
right
back
all
out
war
germany
japan
had
squashed
after
all
million
more
british
had
already
died
hundreds
thousands
french
couple
hundread
thousand
so
americans
millions
russians
mention
few
million
jews
poles
other
people
slavic
descent
german
concentration
camps
all
things
considered
fire
bombings
atomic
bomb
were
essential
therefore
justified
bringing
war
quick
end
avoid
even
greater
allied
losses
i
one
don
regret
war
never
exact
science
smart
bombs
becoming
more
exact
smaller
percentage
civilian
casualties
sometimes
mistakes
made
targets
misidentified
innocents
die
war
way
really
entrenched
political
rulers
operating
own
selfish
interests
without
regard
lives
other
people
way
war
really
sure
people
who
suffer
because
them
all
more
reason
depose
entrenched
political
rulers
operating
own
selfish
interests
do
you
mean
applies
allies
well
why
all
fuss
about
kuwait
east
timor
bosnia
even
tibet
iraq
so
bad
why
were
we
still
selling
them
stuff
couple
weeks
before
we
started
bombing
i
make
claim
effort
justify
misguided
foreign
policy
west
before
war
evident
west
especially
america
misjudged
hussein
drastically
once
hussein
invaded
kuwait
threatened
militarily
corner
significant
portion
world
oil
supply
he
had
stopped
sure
war
could
have
been
prevented
judicious
concerted
effort
part
west
before
hussein
invaded
kuwait
still
hussein
who
responsible
his
decision
invade
once
he
did
so
strong
response
from
west
required
mathew
your
sarcasm
noted
you
completely
off
base
here
you
come
off
sounding
like
complete
peace
nik
idiot
although
i
feel
sure
your
intent
what
your
intent
sound
like
loving
christian
well
you
aren
doing
very
good
job
well
very
loving
allow
hussein
hitler
gobble
up
nearby
countries
keep
them
allow
them
continue
mass
slaughter
certain
peoples
under
dominion
so
i
d
have
say
yes
stopping
hussein
most
loving
thing
do
most
people
involved
once
he
set
his
mind
military
conquest
so
iraqi
war
wrong
eh
i
m
sure
appeasement
would
have
worked
better
than
war
just
like
did
ww
eh
who
even
mentioned
appeasement
what
makes
you
think
situation
even
remotely
analogous
world
war
two
i
mentioned
we
hadn
intervened
allowing
hussein
keep
kuwait
would
have
been
appeasement
precisely
lessons
world
learned
ww
motivated
western
alliance
war
letting
hitler
take
austria
czechoslavkia
did
stop
ww
from
happening
letting
hussein
keep
kuwait
would
have
stopped
eventual
gulf
war
protect
saudi
arabia
i
guess
we
shouldn
have
fought
ww
either
just
think
all
those
innocent
german
civilians
killed
dresden
hamburg
yes
do
germans
human
too
you
know
sure
what
truly
unfortunate
followed
hitler
his
grandiose
quest
thousand
year
reich
consequences
stemmed
from
tyrants
like
hussein
have
stopped
his
kind
don
understand
diplomacy
only
understand
point
gun
my
only
regret
bush
wimped
out
didn
have
military
roll
baghdad
so
now
hussein
still
power
iraqi
people
sacrifice
mention
americans
who
died
naught
i
look
forward
hearing
your
incisive
comments
about
east
timor
tibet
what
should
i
say
about
them
anything
particular
poor
poor
rodney
king
did
you
ever
stop
think
why
jury
first
trial
brought
back
verdict
guilty
yes
amongst
things
i
thought
were
hmm
awful
lot
white
people
jury
so
policemen
trial
rodney
king
under
american
law
deserved
jury
peers
had
been
black
officers
involved
i
m
sure
would
have
been
black
jurors
too
point
allegedly
racial
motivations
really
shallow
those
who
have
been
foaming
mouth
blood
those
policemen
certainly
have
looked
further
than
video
tape
jury
looked
all
evidence
evidence
which
you
i
have
seen
when
i
see
bunch
policemen
beating
someone
who
lying
defenceless
ground
rather
hard
imagine
what
other
evidence
might
have
been
so
hard
imagine
so
when
has
argument
from
incredulity
gained
acceptance
from
revered
author
constructing
logical
argument
can
we
expect
another
revision
soon
just
kidding
some
wonderful
evidence
why
seemingly
being
kept
secret
why
tell
everyone
what
everyone
could
say
oh
yes
you
re
right
king
deserved
good
beating
we
could
all
live
happily
ever
after
i
have
admit
i
wonder
too
neither
prosecution
nor
defense
talking
so
one
cannot
conclude
either
way
due
silence
principals
law
country
intended
protect
rights
accused
whether
criminals
cops
one
found
guilty
reasonable
doubt
one
guilt
only
jury
position
assess
evidence
render
verdict
fine
i
m
still
finding
hard
imagine
what
reasonable
doubt
case
i
mean
cops
certainly
seem
beating
someone
who
lying
defenceless
ground
what
your
explanation
mass
hallucination
orbital
mind
control
lasers
faked
video
footage
do
tell
ok
certainly
seemed
me
excessive
force
involved
frankly
original
guilty
verdict
baffled
me
too
i
learned
prosecution
first
case
did
try
convict
charge
excessive
force
simple
assault
which
probably
would
have
won
tried
get
conviction
charge
aggravated
assault
intent
inflict
serious
bodily
harm
charge
which
news
commentators
said
akin
attempted
murder
under
california
law
based
what
prosecution
asking
evident
first
jury
decided
officers
were
guilty
note
guilty
doing
wrong
guilty
aggravated
assault
intent
inflicting
serious
bodily
harm
seeds
prosecutions
defeat
were
own
overconfidence
obtaining
verdict
went
most
extreme
charge
could
facts
news
commentators
presented
them
true
i
feel
guilty
verdict
reasonable
one
mathew
thou
shalt
kill
unless
thou
hast
pretty
good
reason
killing
which
case
thou
shalt
kill
also
kill
anyone
who
gets
way
unfortunately
cannot
helped

i
like

pretty
funny
actually
i
m
monty

fan
you
know
kind
seems
vein
course
oversimplifying
any
moral
