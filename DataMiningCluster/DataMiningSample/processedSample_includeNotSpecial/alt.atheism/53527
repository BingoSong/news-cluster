i
strongly
suggest
you
look
up
book
called
bible
quran
science
maurice
baucaille
french
surgeon
comprehensive
he
unable
find
wealth
scientific
statements
holy
qur
what
he
did
find
made
sense
modern
understanding
so
he
investigated
traditions
hadith
see
what
had
say
about
science
were
filled
science
problems
after
all
were
contemporary
narratives
from
time
which
had
pour
standards
primitive
world
view
his
conclusion
while
he
impressed
what
little
holy
qur
had
say
about
science
accurate
he
far
more
impressed
holy
qur
did
contain
same
rampant
errors
evidenced
traditions
how
would
man
th
century
arabia
have
known
what
include
holy
qur
assuming
he
had
authored
book
worth
read
get
sensible
view
issue
book
two
sections
section
contains
fairly
reasonable
analysis
bible
showing
many
inconsistencies
between
bible
modern
science
well
we
all
know
surprises
section
analyses
koran
version
old
testament
stories
seems
face
present
good
case
showing
koran
consistent
modern
science
however
plain
me
consistency
only
possible
vague
phraseology
koran
take
flood
example
bible
full
detail
forty
days
forty
nights
pair
every
animal
etc
we
all
know
nonsense
koran
description
same
event
so
obscure
make
possible
interpretation
big
river
flooded
few
days
caused
much
damage
yes
contradiction
also
much
fact
koran
might
consistent
modern
science
being
consistent
due
its
vagueness
compared
other
books
time
does
seem
much
achievement
book
concludes
saying
something
like
koran
must
have
had
divine
inspiration
because
time
written
were
lot
us
now
ridiculous
ideas
about
universe
none
them
can
found
koran
arguing
greatness
book
talking
about
what
does
contain
seems
absurd
extreme
above
course
from
memory
so
i
may
have
missed
some
points
