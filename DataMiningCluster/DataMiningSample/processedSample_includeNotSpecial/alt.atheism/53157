re
death
penalty
re
political
atheists
death
penalty
conceived
deterrent
crime
legal
shenanigans
have
been
added
automatic
appeals
lengthy
court
battles
etc
have
relegated
purpose
very
small
part
what
should
hence
question
do
we
instate
death
penalty
meant
see
deters
crime
do
we
get
rid
entirely
i
doubt
death
penalty
supposed
deterrent
crime
so
why
doesn
every
crime
carry
death
penalty
would
effictive
wouldn
death
penalty
punishment
much
like
fine
speeding
punishment
anyway
somebody
murder
mind
doesn
much
care
about
consequences
i
think
another
problem
people
dont
think
get
caught
i
wanted
kill
another
person
i
wouldn
care
what
penalty
i
didn
think
i
would
get
caught
strictly
deterrent
should
have
been
more
along
lines
torture
