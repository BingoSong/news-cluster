means
i
can
possibly
think
prove
beyond
doubt
god
does
exist
anyone
has
one
all
means
tell
me
what
therefore
lacking
ability
absolute
proof
being
atheist
becomes
act
faith
itself
i
cannot

i

i
harbor

all
good
evidence
god
existing
some
folks
call
agnosticism
does
suffer
from
blind
faith
all
i
think
don
worry
happy
many
atheists
lack
belief
gods
secondary
epistemological
consideration
what
do
we
accept
reliable
way
knowing
known
valid
logical
arguments
existence
gods
nor
any
empirical
evidence
exist
most
philosophers
theologians
agree
idea
god
one
must
accepted
faith
faith
belief
without
sound
logical
basis
empirical
evidence
reliable
way
knowing
probably
nothing
else
most
people
would
accept
absence
any
possibility
proof
even
when
we
agree
take
someone
elses
word
faith
we
just
mean
having
found
person
reliable
past
we
judge
him
likely
reliable
source
now
we
find
faith
less
reliable
than
logic
empirical
evidence
everywhere
else
why
assume
provide
reliable
knowledge
about
gods
difference
between
atheist
theist
fundamentally
one
whether
faith
held
reliable
way
knowing
rather
than
some
agnostic
posters
would
have
whether
ones
faith
gods
gods
theist
believes
faith
acceptable
basis
belief
gods
even
he
rejects
faith
reliable
other
times
example
his
work
scientist
atheist
believes
only
logic
empirical
evidence
lead
reliable
knowledge
agnosticism
seems
me
less
defensible
position
than
theism
atheism
unless
one
sceptic
regards
all
other
knowledge
without
evidence
why
should
we
believe
gods
rather
than
santa

easter
bunny
i
would
also
like
point
out
others
have
atheist
doesn
require
absolute
knowledge
lack
gods
i
don
believe
any
thing
absolute
knowledge
atheism
best
simplest
theory
fit
lack
facts
so
should
held
until
contrary
