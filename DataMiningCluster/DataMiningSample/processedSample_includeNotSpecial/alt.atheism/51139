science
wonderful
answering
most
our
questions
i
m
type
question
scientific
findings
very
often
personally
i
find
theory
evolution
unfathomable
could
humans
highly
evolved
complex
organism
thinks
learns
develops
truly
organism
resulted
from
random
genetic
mutations
natural
selection
stuff
deleted
computers
excellent
example
evolution
without
creator
we
did
create
computers
we
did
create
sand
goes
silicon
goes
integrated
circuits
go
processor
board
we
took
things
put
them
together
interesting
way
just
like
plants
create
oxygen
using
light
through
photosynthesis
much
bigger
leap
talk
about
something
created
everything
from
nothing
i
find
unfathomable
resort
believing
creator

much
simpler
alternative
exists
we
simply
incapable
understanding
our
beginnings
even
were
beginnings
all
ok
me
present
keeps
me
perfectly
busy
