someone
tells
me
islam
says
i
immediately

my
islamic
duty
according
one
hadith
prophet
peace
blessings
god
him
your

tells
you
enter
fire
you
do
kill
yourself

own
actions
abu
hanifa
imam
malik
etc
even
i
am
blindly
following
opinions
abu
hanifa
etc
mind
my
understanding
we
must
look
reasoning
behind
opinions
muslims
support
khomeini
fatwa
now
my
understanding
hadith
upon
which
those
who
support
khomeini
fatwa
relating
particular
instance
occurred
during
war
time
now
brother
general
imho
ridiculous
wrong
say
hadith
relating
actions
war
usable
during
times
peace
i
think
any
sensible
human
being
can
see
so
i
personally
think
reasoning
some
our
ulema
matter
faulty
think
legitimate
use
acts
war
times
peace
regarding
particular
subject
you
think
i
am
wrong
please
feel
free
say
so
your
reasoning
from
qur
hadith
please
because
somebody
said
so
i
want
reasoning
from
al
qur
sahih
hadiths
perhaps
we
should
take
our
discussion
soc
religion
islam
please
email
me
rashid

think
we
should
do
way
i
also
disagree

i
reiterate
i
would
agree
you
little
justification
punishment
apostasy
qur
islamic
history
well
apostasy
has
rarely
been
punished
belief
considered
matter
conscience
since

apostates
have
been
generally

however
when

charges
perhaps
charges
sedition

situation
likewise
complicated

falsehoods
again
situation
changes
punishments
vary
according

muslims
here
small
group
even
single
individual
could
said
engaged
practise
other
words
clear
difference
between
formal
war
situation
where
two
clearly
defined
parties
wage
war
conclude
treaties
exchange
prisoners
etc
dealing
attacks
come
from
isolated
individuals
