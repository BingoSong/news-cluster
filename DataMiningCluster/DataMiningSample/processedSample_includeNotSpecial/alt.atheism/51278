my
point
view
argument
all
sexism
bad
just
simply
does
hold
let
me
give
you
example
how
about
permitting
woman
temporarily
leave
her
job
due
pregnancy
should
allowed
happens
sexist
gives
particular
right
only
women
nevertheless
despite
fact
sexist
i
completely
support
law
because
i
think
just
fred
you
re
exasperating
sexism
like
racialism
form
discrimination
using
obvious
physical
cultural
differences
deny
one
portion
population
same
rights
another
context
your
example
above
holds
water
whatsoever
discrimination
denying
men
maternity
leave
fact
i
m
quite
convinced
were
anyone
experiment
male
pregnancy
would
possible
future
father
take
leave
medical
grounds
okay
i
argued
thoroughly
about
weeks
ago
men
women
different
physically
physiologically
psychologically
much
recent
evidence
statement
present
book
brainsex
anne
moir
david
jessel
i
recommend
you
find
copy
read
book
overview
recent
scientific
research
topic
well
referenced
now
women
men
different
some
ways
law
can
only
adequately
take
account
needs
areas
where
different
also
taking
account
ways
which
men
women
different
maternity
leave
example
takes
account
women
get
pregnant
does
give
women
same
rules
would
give
men
because
treat
women
like
treats
men
instance
would
unjust
just
simply
obvious
example
where
men
women
intrinsically
different
now
people
make
naive
argument
sexism
oppression
however
maternity
leave
sexist
because
men
do
get
pregnant
men
do
have
same
access
leave
women
do
same
extent
degree
therefore
sexist
matter
however
much
man
wants
get
pregnant
have
maternity
leave
he
never
can
therefore
law
sexist
man
can
have
access
maternity
leave
matter
how
hard
he
tries
get
pregnant
i
hope
clear
maternity
leave
example
where
sexist
law
just
because
sexism
here
just
reflects
sexism
nature
making
men
women
different
many
other
differences
between
men
women
which
far
more
subtle
than
pregnancy
find
out
more
i
recommend
you
have
look
book
brainsex
your
point
perhaps
some
day
men
can
also
pregnant
fallacious
men
can
one
day
become
pregnant
having
biologically
become
women
have
womb
other
factors
required
pregnancy
usually
wrapped
up
definition
what
woman
so
your
argument
when
examined
seen
fallacious
you
saying
men
can
have
sexist
maternity
leave
privilege
women
can
have
also
become
women
which
actually
just
supports
my
statement
maternity
leave
sexist
discrimination
comes
when
woman
denied
opportunities
because
her
legally
determined
sexual
inferiorities
i
understand
most
religious
sexual
discrimination
i
doubt
islam
exceptional
female
allowed
priestly
caste
general
subjugated
so
she
has
aspirations
rights
which
equal
human
she
ought
entitled
official
priesthood
islam
much
function
taken
islamic
scholars
female
islamic
scholars
female
islamic
scholars
have
always
existed
islam
example
from
early
islamic
history
prophet
widow
aisha
who
recognized
her
time
recognized
our
time
islamic
scholar
matter
how
sweetly
you
coat
part
role
religions
seems
historically
have
served
function
oppressing
female
whether
forcing
her
procreate
extent
where
opportunity
self
improvement
denying
her
access
same
facilities
males
offered
you
have
evidence
your
blanket
statement
about
all
religions
i
dispute
i
could
go
about
women
islam
etc
i
recently
reposted
something
here
under
heading
islam
women
still
your
news
site
i
suggest
you
read
reposted
from
soc
religion
islam
so
has
disappeared
from
alt
atheism
still
might
soc
religion
islam
i
forgot
what
its
original
title
though
i
email
you
you
like
roman
catholic
church
most
blatant
culprit
because
actually
istitutionalised
celibate
clergy
other
religious
different
let
woman
attempt
escape
her
role
child
bearer
wrath
god
descends
her
your
statement
other
religions
different
i
think
statement
based
simply
lack
knowledge
about
religions
other
than
christianity
perhaps
judaism
i
ll
accept
your
affirmation
islam
grants
women
same
rights
men
when
you
can
show
me
any
muslim
woman
can
aspire
same
position
say
khomeini
artificial
religious
social
obstacles
her
path
achieve
aisha
who
i
mentioned
earlier
only
islamic
scholar
also
one
stage
military
leader
show
me
equivalent
hillary
rhodam
clinton
within
islam
i
may
consider
discussing
issue
you
prophet
first
wife
who
died
just
before
hijra
prophet
journey
from
mecca
medina
successful

lucio
you
cannot

your

when
