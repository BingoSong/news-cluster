like
know
what
relativism
concludes
when
two
people
grotesquely
disagree
both
right
b
one
them
wrong
sometimes
though
perhaps
rarely
we
have
pretty
good
idea
who
c
one
them
wrong
we
never
have
any
information
who
so
we
make
our
best
guess
we
really
must
make
decision
d
idea
right
moral
judgement
meaningless
implying
whether
peace
better
than

e

meaningless
question

i
hope
you
can
tell
b
c
actually
predicated
assumption
values
real
so
statements
like
can
consistently
derive
from
relativist
assumption
values
aren
part
objective

i
am
relativist
who
would
like
answer
your
question
way
you
phrase
question
makes
unanswerable
concepts
right
wrong
correct
incorrect
true
false
belong
domain
epistemological
rather
than
moral
questions
makes
sense
ask
moral
position
right
wrong
although
legitimate
ask
good
better
than
another
position
let
me
illustrate
point
looking
psychological
derivatives
epistemology
ethics
perception
motivation
respectively
one
can
certainly
ask
percept
right
correct
true
veridical
wrong
incorrect
false
illusory
makes
little
sense
ask
motive
true
false
other
hand
strange
ask
whether
percept
morally
good
evil
one
can
certainly
ask
question
about
motives
therefore
your
suggested
answers
c
simply
can
considered
assume
you
can
judge
correctness
moral
judgment

all
one
cannot
feel
peace
better

i
certainly
can
make

judgments
bad
better
best
without

sorry
lengthy
dismissal
d
my
