writes
argument
goes
follows
q
oid
quotes
appear
john
almost
codified
way
were
matthew
luke
however
considered
similar
enough
point
knowledge
q
entirely
different
source
assuming
you
presenting
accurately
i
don
see
how
argument
really
leads
any
firm
conclusion
material
john
i
m
sure
exactly
what
referred
here
i
ll
take
granted
similarity
matt
luke
q
material
different
hence
one
could
have
almost
any
relationship
between
two

matthew
probably
mark
version

theory
i
have
heard
has
matthew
luke
independently
relying
mark
q
one
would
think
luke
relied
matthew
we
wouldn
have
grating
inconsistencies
geneologies
one
thing

john
knew
content
luke
text
evidence
overwhelming
admittedly
part
particularly
new
me
were
possible
you
could
point
me
reference
i
d
grateful
unfortunately
i
haven
got
info
hand
i
think
late
early
possibly
old
ce
when
from
about
why
do
shed
doubt
order
putting
john
after
rest
three
because
closes
up
gap
between
supposed
writing
existing
copy
quit
bit
further
away
from
original
more
copies
can
written
therefore
survival
becomes
more
probable
i
don
think
one
step
removed
source
bad
luke
mark
matthew
learned
stories
directly
from
diciples
i
really
cannot
believe
sort
big
transformation
from
jesus
gospel
some
people
posit
news
reports
one
generally
gets
better
information
than
john
diciple
nothing
more
said
john
disciple
generally
accepted
style

theology
usually
used
counterargument
i
m
really
impressed
theology
argument
i
m
really
pointing

i
pointed
out
earlier
one
cannot
make
arguments
about
i
peter
i
see
reason
accept
authentic
letter
one
step
one
generation
removed
bad
even
our
times
compare

similar

our
century
almost
illiterate
societies
best
analogy
would
reporters
talking
participants
which
so
bad
other

one
does
know
what

look
