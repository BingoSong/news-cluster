deletia
case
anybody
hadn
noticed
frank
i
debating
objective
morality
seemingly
hitting
semantics
secondly
how
can
i
refute
your
definition
i
can
only
point
up
its
logical
implications
say
seem
contradict
usage
word
objective
other
areas
indeed
your
definition
objective
x
oxymoron
all
x
i
have
quibble
belief
other
than
useless
objective
perfectly
good
word
may
being
non
native
english
speaker
i
ve
misunderstood
your
usage
objective
tried
debate
something
you
don
assert
my
apologies
i
m
loss
imagine
what
you
really
do
mean
though
how
many
ages
can
universe
have
still
internally
self
consistent
i
d
amazed
more
than
one
how
many
different
moral
systems
can
different
members
society
have
indeed
single
individuals
some
cases
humanity
still
stick
together
begging
question
people
can
have
many
opinions
about
age
universe
humanity
can
still
stick
together
you
saying
universe
has
real
age
independent
my
beliefs
about
why
wrong
point
age
universe
has
direct
effect
humanity
sticking
power
way
moral
system
society
can
have
i
m
saying
universe
has
real
age
because
i
see
evidence
cosmology
astronomy
so
i
say
age
independent
people
opinions
because
i
know
different
people
have
lot
different
opinions
matter
yet
empirical
tests
consistently
seem
give
roughly
same
results
age
universe
like
most
scientific
facts
can
emirically
verified
through
means
ll
give
same
result
matter
who
performs
testing
albeit
error
bars
may
largish
side
assumes
universe
has
real
age
any
kind
reality
which
doesn
depend
what
we
think
i
can
see
how
does
put
creationist
task
performing
tests
calculations
see
he
makes
blatant
errors
measuring
calculating
result
test
same
why
should
extreme
biblical
creationist
give
rat
ass
about
means
which
you
speak
because
logically
consistent
empirical
tests
contradict
opinion
those
tests
were
just
my
opinion
own
tests
which
would
opinion
would
contradict
mine
even
we
conducted
said
tests
identical
manner
don
which
i
take
showing
tests
have
some
validity
beyond
our
opinion
them
i
ve
heard
way
verify
morality
consistent
way
much
less
compute
errors
measurement
care
enlighten
me
same
true
pain
painkillers
exist
can
predicted
work
some
accuracy
better
than
random
guess
map
activity
nerves
neural
activity
you
mean
physical
pain
you
have
sharp
point
i
ll
give
you
you
still
haven
given
me
way
quantify
morality
i
wrote
elsewhere
morality
should
hypotheses
about
observed
value
we
agree
hypotheses
however
can
change
i
hold
ultimate
hypothesis
morality
towards
which
changes
could
gravitate
could
changed
any
way
imaginable
producing
different
results
suitable
different
tasks
purposes
moral
system
makes
prediction
better
can
tested
better
worse
almost
always
defined
context
moral
system
your
prediction
always
correct
within
moral
system
what
you
need
now
objective
definition
good
bad
i
wish
you
luck
people
ideas
about
age
object
x
objective
you
can
have
any
idea
you
like
i
can
stop
you
universae
ages
another
ballgame
what
you
dislike
some
detail
them
problem
your
opinion
them
sure
assume
objective
reality
you
get
statements
like
isn
what
you
re
doing
when
assuming
objectively
real
morality
besides
what
exactly
provably
wrong
my
statement
i
claim
morality
opinion
ours
subjective
individual
i
m
wrong
some
more
less
objectively
real
thing
exists
which
you
label
objective
morality
can
you
back
up
positive
claim
existence
can
you
back
up
your
positive
claim
above
because
assumption
i
make
same
assumption
about
values
basis
logical
difference
between
two
empirical
basis
two
precisely
same
claiming
objective
morality
suddenly
positive
claim
besides
i
think
i
can
lend
some
credence
my
claim
ponder
different
individuals
both
fully
functional
human
beings
members
society
yet
wildly
different
moral
codes
morality
objective
least
one
should
way
off
base
yet
hir
incorrect
morality
seems
function
fine
how
come
producing
individuals
might
easiest
pick
them
from
different
societies
say
islamic
one
some
polynesian
matrilineal
system
example
still
exist
deletia
testing
footballs
desks
now
take
look
morality
see
anything
so
please
inform
me
which
way
look
why
look
particular
way
opposed
some
other
get
my
drift
just
look
you
claiming
never
know
what
good
means
one
thing
good
under
some
circumstances
because
we
wish
achieve
some
goal
some
reason
other
times
we
wish
do
something
else
thing
longer
so
clearly
good
all
some
things
hard
make
good
because
we
d
seldom
ever
wish
achieve
sort
goal
mass
murder
would
lead
one
still
aztecs
were
doing
fine
until
spaniards
wiped
them
out
i
almost
always
know
what
good
means
sometimes
i
even
know
why
i
never
claim
good
thereby
fixed
stone
immutable
simple
matter
proving
track
record
scientific
method
i
think
great
should
applied
values
i
may
completely
wrong
what
i
conclude
result
quite
amount
thought
yes
me
too
i
ve
tried
thing
two
down
line
doesn
look
good
objective
values
me
all
