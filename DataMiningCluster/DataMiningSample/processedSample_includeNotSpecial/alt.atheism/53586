morals
come
from
what
societally
accepted
why
follow
what
right
do
we
have
expect
others
follow
our
notion
societally
mandated
morality
pardon
extremism
couldn
i
murder
your
brother
say
i
exercising
my
rights
i
saw
them
doing
what
felt
good
didn
want
anyone
forcing
morality
me
i
don
follow
your
morality
i
believe
morality
subjective
each
person
entitled
his
own
moral
attitudes
mine
priori
more
correct
than
someone
elses
does
mean
however
i
must
judge
another
basis
his
rather
than
my
moral
standards
while
he
entitled
believe
what
his
own
moral
sense
tells
him
rest
society
entitled
pass
laws
spelling
out
punishments
behavior
offensive
majority
why
your
last
statement
why
which
authority
most
criminals
do
see
behavior
moral
may
realize
immoral
care
thus
following
own
moral
system
being
immoral
someone
lay
claim
alternative
moral
system
he
must
sincere
his
belief
must
internally
consistent
why
your
last
statement
why
things
necessary
believe
me
belief
terrorism
can
both
sincere
frighteningly
consistent
some
sociopaths
lack
innate
moral
sense
thus
may
incapable
behaving
morally
while
someone
like
hitler
may
have
believed
his
actions
were
moral
we
may
judge
him
immoral
our
standards
holding
morality
subjective
does
mean
we
must
excuse
murderer
trouble
would
sound
just
fine
coming
from
someone
like
hitler
too
i
do
mean
any
comparison
offence
