news
hour
try

fair
reporting
news
even
conservative
sources
out
you
know
where
look
hurrah
rush
any
idea
how
many
kill
files
you
just
ended
up
i
atheist
am
arguing
against
killing
innocent
people
you
supposed
christian
arguing
ok
kill
innocent
people
so
long
you
get
some
guilty
ones
well
hardly
i
didn
say
good
thing
tm
kill
innocent
people
end
just
unfortunately
we
don
live
perfect
world
perfect
solutions
one
going
resist
tyranny
innocent
people
both
sides
going
suffer
die
i
didn
say
ok
unfortunate
sometimes
necessary
ends
justify
means
eh
you
having
criticised
moral
relativism
past
now
arguing
i
am
position
judge
morality
allied
actions
end
war
you
certainly
position
you
moral
relativist
same
tired
old
misunderstanding
moral
relativism
means
objective
standard
morality
doesn
mean
you
can
judge
other
people
morals
christ
bike
how
many
times
have
we
tried
hammer
your
head
where
your
christian
love
where
your
absolute
morality
oh
how
quick
you
discard
them
when
suits
you
ivan
stang
would
say
jesus
would
puke
one
day
i
stand
before
jesus
give
account
every
word
action
even
discourse
forum
i
understand
full
ramifications
i
am
prepared
do
so
i
don
believe
you
can
make
same
claim
obviously
i
am
atheist
i
don
think
you
d
get
jesus
though
he
long
haired
lunatic
peace
nik
he
btw
reason
i
brought
up
blanket
bombing
germany
because
you
were
bemoaning
iraqi
civilian
casualties
being
so
deplorable
yet
blanket
bombing
instituted
because
bombing
wasn
accurate
enough
hit
industrial
military
targets
decisive
way
any
other
method
time
gulf
war
precision
bombing
norm
so
point
why
make
big
stink
about
relatively
few
civilian
casualties
resulted
spite
precision
bombing
when
so
many
more
civilians
proportionately
quantitatively
died
under
blanket
bombing
ww
right
unfortunately
you
turned
out
my
opinions
matter
were
entirely
consistent
i
condemned
bombing
dresden
too
i
think
you
re
being
bit
glib
your
explanation
blanket
bombing
policy
too
you
make
sound
though
we
were
aiming
military
targets
could
only
get
them
destroying
civilian
buildings
next
door
i
understand
case
we
aimed
deliberately
civilian
targets
order
cause
massive
damage
inspire
terror
amongst
german
people
civilians
suffer
less
civilians
suffered
war
than
any
other
iany
other
history
oh
come
wars
like
falklands
fresh
people
minds
sort
propaganda
isn
going
fool
anyone
stories
hundreds
thousands
iraqi
civilian
dead
just
plain
bunk
yes
bunk
us
lost
servicemen
ww
over
four
years
majority
them
were
directly
involved
fighting
yes
what
about
millions
casualties
russians
suffered
hardly
surprising
us
didn
lose
many
men
ww
given
you
turned
up
late
