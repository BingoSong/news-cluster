i
ve
seen
referrences
creation
vs
evolution
several
times
i
have
question
either
point
view
derived
from
direct
observation
can
either
scientific
i
wonder
whole
controversy
more
concerned
consequences
truth
rather
than
truth
itself
both
sides
seem
hold
philosophical
outcome
i
can
help
wondering
which
came
first
i
ve
pointed
out
elsewhere
my
view
human
nature
makes
me
believe
way
knowing
anyhthing
objectively
all
knowledge
inherently
subjective
so
context
would
you
take
stand
based
what
you
actually
know
true
what
you
want
true
how
can
you
tell
difference
