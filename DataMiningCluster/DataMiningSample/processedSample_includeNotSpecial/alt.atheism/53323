which
liberal

we
talking
about
western
news
general
particular
american
mass
media
cbs
nbc
abc
etc
general
tone
news
during
whole
war
one
those
poor
poor
iraqis
along
look
how
precisely
cruise
missile
blew
building
bits
most
odd
over
here
very
little
about
suffering
iraqi
civilians
until
towards
end
war
confined
few
remaining
quality
newspapers
true
first
news
media
seemed
entranced
all
new
gizmos
military
using
mention
taped
video
transmissions
from
missiles
zeroed
targets
later
especially
after
bunker
full
civilians
hit
changed
tone
seemed
me
didn
have
stomach
reality
war
innocent
people
really
do
die
maimed
warfare
like
were
only
pro
gulf
war
long
nice
clean
smart
missiles
dropping
military
hqs
when
pictures
dead
dying
maimed
civilians
started
cropping
up
what
naive
hypocrites
how
about
all
innocent
people
who
died
blanket
bombing
ww
i
don
hear
you
bemoaning
them
discussion
about
blanket
bombing
bombs
deleted
all
things
considered
fire
bombings
atomic
bomb
were
essential
therefore
justified
bringing
war
quick
end
avoid
even
greater
allied
losses
i
should
have
said
here
militarily
justified
seems
from
your
comments
below
you
understood
meaning
morally
justified
i
apologize
what
about
evidence
america
knew
japan
about
surrender
after
hiroshima
before
nagasaki
another
lie
peddled
liberal
media
conspiracy
i
have
often
wondered
about
i
ve
always
thought
first
bomb
should
have
been
dropped
japan
island
fortress
truk
good
inpenatrable
military
target
second
bomb
could
ve
been
held
back
use
industrial
center
need
i
digress
yes
i
have
heard
we
found
evidence
after
war
btw
japan
seriously
considering
surrender
after
first
bomb
unfortunately
military
junta
won
out
over
moderates
rejected
us
ulimatum
therefore
second
bomb
dropped
most
unfortunate
imo
i
one
don
regret
nuke
jap
jesus
i
don
regret
fact
sometimes
military
decisions
have
made
which
affect
lives
innocent
people
i
do
regret
circumstances
which
make
those
decisions
necessary
i
regret
suffering
caused
those
decisions
why
all
fuss
about
kuwait
east
timor
bosnia
even
tibet
iraq
so
bad
why
were
we
still
selling
them
stuff
couple
weeks
before
we
started
bombing
i
make
claim
effort
justify
misguided
foreign
policy
west
before
war
evident
west
especially
america
misjudged
hussein
drastically
once
hussein
invaded
kuwait
threatened
militarily
corner
significant
portion
world
oil
supply
he
had
stopped
oh
i
see
so
we
can
overlook
his
using
chemical
weapons
thousands
people
he
threatens
your
right
drive
huge
gas
guzzling
car
well
man
gotta
go
actually
fact
both
situations
existed
prompted
us
allied
action
some
back
water
country
took
over
some
other
back
water
country
we
probably
wouldn
intervene
we
don
care
we
can
world
policman
coup
had
occured
kuwait
instead
invasion
we
still
wouldn
have
acted
because
would
have
been
imminent
danger
perceived
saudi
arabia
combination
two
unprovoked
invasion
genocidal
tyrant
potential
danger
west
oil
interests
caused
us
take
action
i
ve
moved
paragraph
from
here
later
we
hadn
intervened
allowing
hussein
keep
kuwait
would
have
been
appeasement
right
did
you
ever
hear
anyone
advocate
course
action
you
just
setting
up
strawman
i
m
setting
up
strawman
all
you
want
argue
against
war
only
logical
alternative
allow
hussein
keep
kuwait
diplomatic
alternatives
including
sanctions
were
ineffective
i
guess
we
shouldn
have
fought
ww
either
just
think
all
those
innocent
german
civilians
killed
dresden
hamburg
yes
do
germans
human
too
you
know
sure
what
truly
unfortunate
followed
hitler
his
grandiose
quest
thousand
year
reich
consequences
stemmed
from
translation
were
asking
well
sense
yes
probably
had
idea
what
end
hitler
would
lead
nation
what
about
those
who
didn
support
hitler
dreams
conquest
democratically
voted
all
his
policies
nsdap
got
elections
last
chance
german
people
got
vote
matter
suffered
along
rest
why
does
bother
you
so
much
world
full
evil
circumstances
perfect
many
innocents
suffer
due
wrongful
actions
others
regretable
way
perfect
solutions
i
look
forward
hearing
your
incisive
comments
about
east
timor
tibet
what
should
i
say
about
them
anything
particular
people
east
timor
still
being
killed
dictatorship
invaded
country
hell
even
western
journalists
have
been
killed
all
happening
before
gulf
war
why
didn
we
send
bombers
east
timor
why
aren
we
sending
bombers
now
probably
because
we
re
saviors
world
we
can
police
each
every
country
decides
self
destruct
invade
another
nor
we
strategic
position
get
relief
tibet
east
timor
some
other
places
here
paragraph
i
moved
what
your
intent
sound
like
loving
christian
well
you
aren
doing
very
good
job
well
very
loving
allow
hussein
hitler
gobble
up
nearby
countries
keep
them
allow
them
continue
mass
slaughter
certain
peoples
under
dominion
so
i
d
have
say
yes
stopping
hussein
most
loving
thing
do
most
people
involved
once
he
set
his
mind
military
conquest
chinese
government
has
policy
mandatory
abortion
sterilization
tibetans
tibetan
people
rounded
up
tortured
executed
amnesty
international
recently
reported
torture
still
widespread
china
why
aren
we
stopping
them
fact
why
we
actively
sucking
up
them
trading
freely
them
tell
me
how
we
could
stop
them
i
ll
support
i
one
do
agree
present
us
policy
sucking
up
them
you
put
i
agree
deplorable
poor
poor
rodney
king
did
you
ever
stop
think
why
jury
first
trial
brought
back
verdict
guilty
yes
amongst
things
i
thought
were
hmm
awful
lot
white
people
jury
so
policemen
trial
rodney
king
erm
surely
irrelevant
who
trial
juries
supposed
represent
cross
section
population
supposed
reflect
population
locale
where
trial
held
normally
where
crime
committed
unless
one
party
other
can
convince
judge
change
venue
order
i
m
expert
california
law
even
us
law
seems
way
system
set
up
you
can
criticize
system
let
have
unfounded
allegations
racial
prejudice
thrown
around
under
american
law
deserved
jury
peers
you
saying
black
people
peers
white
people
all
point
fact
were
blacks
first
jury
rodney
king
black
totally
irrelevant
point
allegedly
racial
motivations
really
shallow
idea
people
only
being
tried
before
jury
people
just
like
them
really
stupid
should
nuremburg
trials
have
had
jury
entirely
made
up
nazis
germans
perhaps
peers
doesn
mean
those
who
do
same
thing
like
having
murderers
judge
murderers
means
having
people
from
same
station
life
presumably
because
better
position
understand
defendent
motivation
those
who
have
been
foaming
mouth
blood
those
policemen
certainly
have
looked
further
than
video
tape
jury
looked
all
evidence
evidence
which
you
i
have
seen
when
i
see
bunch
policemen
beating
someone
who
lying
defenceless
ground
rather
hard
imagine
what
other
evidence
might
have
been
so
hard
imagine
so
when
has
argument
from
incredulity
gained
acceptance
from
revered
author
constructing
logical
argument
we
re
talking
about
logical
argument
we
re
talking
about
court
law
faq
points
out
some
fallacious
arguments
viewed
fallacies
court
law
ok
granted
however
you
using
reasoning
part
your
logical
argument
discussion
court
law
facts
news
commentators
presented
them
true
i
feel
guilty
verdict
reasonable
one
were
you
talking
earlier
about
bias
liberal
media
conspiracy
media
totally
monolithic
even
though
prevailing
liberal
bias
programs
macneil
lehrer
news
hour
try
give
balanced
fair
reporting
news
even
conservative
sources
out
you
know
where
look
hurrah
rush
btw
i
never
used
word
conspiracy
i
don
accept
without
far
more
evidence
theories
some
all
pervading
liberal
conspiracy
attempting
take
over
all
news
sources
thou
shalt
kill
unless
thou
hast
pretty
good
reason
killing
which
case
thou
shalt
kill
also
kill
anyone
who
gets
way
unfortunately
cannot
helped
jim
brown
bible
loving
christians
thanks
mathew
i
like
quote
pretty
funny
actually
i
m
monty
python
fan
you
know
kind
seems
vein
course
oversimplifying
any
moral
argument
can
make
seem
contradictory
you
know
already
ha
ha
only
serious
i
atheist
am
arguing
against
killing
innocent
people
you
supposed
christian
arguing
ok
kill
innocent
people
so
long
you
get
some
guilty
ones
well
hardly
i
didn
say
good
thing
tm
kill
innocent
people
end
just
unfortunately
we
don
live
perfect
world
perfect
solutions
one
going
resist
tyranny
innocent
people
both
sides
going
suffer
die
i
didn
say
ok
unfortunate
sometimes
necessary
i
moral
relativist
am
arguing
saturation
bombing
german
cities
end
world
war
ii
far
i
can
see
evil
unnecessary
act
i
would
agree
evil
sense
caused
much
pain
suffering
i
m
so
sure
unnecessary
you
say
conclusion
can
only
arrived
evaluating
all
factors
involved
perhaps
unnecessary
let
say
we
now
know
doesn
mean
those
who
had
make
decision
bomb
didn
see
being
necessary
rarely
can
one
have
full
known
consequences
action
before
making
decision
time
may
have
seemed
necessary
enough
go
ahead
don
assume
i
feel
bombing
morally
justified
i
don
i
just
don
condemn
those
who
had
make
difficult
decision
under
difficult
circumstances
you
having
criticised
moral
relativism
past
now
arguing
i
am
position
judge
morality
allied
actions
end
war
you
certainly
position
you
moral
relativist
i
absolutist
am
position
judge
i
defer
judgment
you
arguing
actions
need
assessed
particular
context
time
might
have
been
moral
moral
now
wrong
were
neither
moral
nor
now
seemed
necessary
those
making
decisions
bring
quick
end
war
i
simply
refuse
condemn
them
decision
where
your
christian
love
where
your
absolute
morality
oh
how
quick
you
discard
them
when
suits
you
ivan
stang
would
say
jesus
would
puke
one
day
i
stand
before
jesus
give
account
every
word
action
even
discourse
forum
i
understand
full
ramifications
i
am
prepared
do
so
i
don
believe
you
can
make
same
claim
mathew
btw
reason
i
brought
up
blanket
bombing
germany
because
you
were
bemoaning
iraqi
civilian
casualties
being
so
deplorable
yet
blanket
bombing
instituted
because
bombing
wasn
accurate
enough
hit
industrial
military
targets
decisive
way
any
other
method
time
gulf
war
precision
bombing
norm
so
point
why
make
big
stink
about
relatively
few
civilian
casualties
resulted
spite
precision
bombing
when
so
many
more
civilians
proportionately
quantitatively
died
under
blanket
bombing
ww
even
precision
bombing
mistakes
happen
some
civilians
suffer
less
civilians
suffered
war
than
any
other
iany
other
history
many
iraqi
civilians
went
about
lives
minimal
interference
from
allied
air
raids
stories
hundreds
thousands
iraqi
civilian
dead
just
plain
bunk
yes
bunk
us
lost
servicemen
ww
over
four
years
majority
them
were
directly
involved
fighting
we
expected
swallow
hundreds
thousands
civilian
iraqis
died
war
lasting
about
months
allies
using
most
precise
bombs
ever
created
what
hogwash
hundreds
thousands
iraqi
civilians
died
due
actions
hussein
took
his
own
people
due
allied
bombing
