morals
come
from
what
societally
accepted
why
follow
what
right
do
we
have
expect
others
follow
our
notion
societally
mandated
morality
pardon
extremism
couldn
i
murder
your
brother
say
i
exercising
my
rights
i
saw
them
doing
what
felt
good
didn
want
anyone
forcing
morality
me
i
don
follow
your
morality
i
believe
morality
subjective
each
person
entitled
his
own
moral
attitudes
mine
priori
more
correct
than
someone
elses
does
mean
however
i
must
judge
another
basis
his
rather
than
my
moral
standards
while
he
entitled
believe
what
his
own
moral
sense
tells
him
rest
society
entitled
pass
laws
spelling
out
punishments
behavior
offensive
majority
why
how
might
makes
right
how
can
force
morality
me
why
can
i
do
what
i
want
who
decide
what
i
disagree
well
i
agree
you
sense
have
moral
right
inflict
rules
one
thing
i
might
add
very
least
almost
everybody
wants
avoid
pain
means
sacrificing
some
stuff
herd
morality
so
most
criminals
do
see
behavior
moral
may
realize
immoral
care
thus
following
own
moral
system
being
immoral
good
point
being
immoral
our
opinion
we
don
let
them
choose
we
make
decision
actions
wrong
them
right
since
grew
up
learned
around
us
have
some
idea
our
right
wrong
which
i
think
must
part
incorporated
very
rarely
do
you
see
criminal
behaviour
philosophical
reasons
someone
lay
claim
alternative
moral
system
he
must
sincere
his
belief
must
internally
consistent
some
sociopaths
lack
innate
moral
sense
i
admit
lean
toward
idea
innate
moral
sense
have
little
basis
yet
how
far
can
concept
extended
stuff
deleted
do
you
mean

would
wrong
us
do
thing
him
after
all
he
behaving
morally
his
own
eyes
doing
what
he
chose
what
basis
do
we
condemn
other
societies
besides
here
buzz
words
idea
some
actions
wrong
all
humans
all
societies
holding
morality
subjective
does
mean
we
must
