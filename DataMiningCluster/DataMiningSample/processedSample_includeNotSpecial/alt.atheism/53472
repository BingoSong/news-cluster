i
think
you
have
misunderstanding
about
atheism
lack
belief
god
does
directly
imply
lack
understanding
transcendental
values
i

accept

buddhists
appreciate
issues
related
non
empirical
reasoning
without
need
automatically
believe
theism
i
think
reading

buddhism
might
revise
fine
tune
your
understanding
non
christian
systems
