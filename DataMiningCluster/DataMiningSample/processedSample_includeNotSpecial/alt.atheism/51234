i
somewhat
agree
u
however
what
comes
theist
religion
different
matter
because
religion
like
drug
once
u
use
very
difficult
get
out
because
order
experience
religion
u
necessarily
have
have
blind
faith
once
u
have
blind
faith
very
diffcult
you
reason
yourself
back
atheism
again
therefore
unreasonable
ask
people
try
religion
order
judge
like
asking
people
try
dying
find
out
what
death
like
well
now
we
can
judge
death
until
we
dead
right
so
why
should
we
judge
religion
without
having
experienced
people
have
said
religion
bad
any
account
way
useful
etc
i
don
totally
agree
course
we
cannot
really
say
how
religious
folk
would
act
had
been
exposed
religion
some
people
least
seemed
helped
some
ways
so
basically
we
can
judge
whether
religion
right
route
given
individual
even
general
population
we
can
say
best
us
personally
least
you
can
choose
use
religion
might
hard
try
find
out
its
benefits
you
state
above
