probability
automobile
system
kill
someone
innocent
accident
goes
asymptotically
close
just
like
court
system
however
anyone
who
doesn
like
automobile
system
can
opt
out
i
have
isn
true
many
people
forced
use
automobile
system
i
certainly
don
use
choice
were
other
ways
getting
around
i
d
do
secondly
we
do
try
make
automobile
system
safe
possible
because
we
do
recognize
danger
innocent
whereas
us
current
example
trying
make
court
system
safer
which
could
fairly
easily
do
replacing
fatal
punishments
non
fatal
punishments
i
think
court
system
has
been
refined
over
hundreds
years
us
britain
other
countries
we
have
tried
make
fair
possible
can
made
better
without
removing
death
penalty
besides
life
imprisonment
sounds
like
fatal
punishment
