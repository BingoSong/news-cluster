how
does

almost
oxymoronic

i
ve
found

andrew

convoluted

athiests
have

make

appear
absurd
rather
than
approach

including
christainity
rational

its

stated
atheists
concoct
outrageous
parodies

accountable
beliefs
don
have
what
more
accurately
oxymoric
term
like
reasonable
atheist
bill
divine
justice
according
most
fundamental
doctrines
christianity
when
first
man
sinned
he
time
you
accuse
him
referencing
mythology
you
procede
launch
your
own
xtian
mythology
time
meeting
all
requirements
myth
here
good
example
what
i
said
above
read
post
again
i
said
acoording
which
means
i
am
referring
christian
doctrine
i
understand
i
am
speaking
myself
you
ll
know
my
purpose
posting
present
basic
overview
christain
doctrines
since
seemed
germane
bill
those
who
pretend
know
what
being
said
what
means
when
atheists
claim
do
know
god
exists
don
know
what
he
wants
contradict
bible
which
clearly
says
everyone
knows
authority
bible
its
claim
should
i
repeat
what
i
wrote
above
sake
getting
across
you
may
trust
bible
your
trusting
doesn
make
any
more
credible
me
bible
says
everyone
knows
clearly
reason
doubt
bible
because
everyone
knows
your
alleged
god
alleged
existance
again
i
am
paraphrasing
christian
doctrine
which
very
clear
point
your
dispute
me
bill
refuted
while
species
wide
condemnation
justified
those
claim
evidence
existence
god
his
unknown
must
deliberately
ignore
bible
ignorance
itself
excuse
don
have
ignore
bible
bible
far
from
universally
accepted
bible
proof
god
only
proof
some
people
have
thought
god
does
prove
even
might
have
been
writing
series
fiction
short
stories
case
dionetics
assuming
writers
believed
only
thing
could
possibly
prove
believed
ignoring
problem
whether
all
interpretations
biblical
philosophers
were
correct
people
who
have
truly
never
heard
bible
again
read
faq
here
again
you
miss
point
bible
itself
point
what
contains
makes
difference
who
accpets
bible
even
who
unaware
its
existence
christians
hold
applies
universally
because
mankind
shares
same
nature
same
fate
same
innate
knowledge
god
see
above
you
read
my
post
same
care
read
faq
we
wouldn

bill
freedom
you
free
ignore
god
same
way
you
free
ignore
gravity
consequences
inevitable
well
known
both
cases
atheist
can
accept
evidence
means
only
bzzt
wrong
answer
gravity
directly
doesn
stop
exerting
direct
rationally
undeniable
influence
you
ignore
god
other

aren
i
said
evidence
you
just
don
accept
here
least
we
agree
bill
secondly
human
reason
very
comforatble
concept
god
so
much
so
itself
intrinsic
our
nature
human
reason
always
comes
back
question
god
every
generation
human
reason
hasn
always
come
back
existance
god
has
usually
come
back
existance
god
other
words
doesn
generally
come
back
xtian
god
comes
back
whether
any
god
much
oriental
philosophic
history
generally
doesn
pop
up
idea
god
so
much
question
what
natural
forces
which
ones
out
from
world
wide
view
human
nature
just
makes
us
wonder
how
universe
came
what

god

wishful

yes
human

does

we

we
bill
i
said
all
make
point
christianity
eminently
reasonable
divine

just
human

much
different
than
what
atheists
