you
ve
been
telling
us
goal
natural
morality
what
animals
do
survive
right
humans
have
gone
somewhat
beyond
though
perhaps
our
goal
one
self
actualization
humans
have
gone
somewhat
beyond
what
exactly
one
thread
you
re
telling
us
natural
morality
what
animals
do
survive
thread
you
claiming
omniscient
being
can
definitely
say
what
right
what
wrong
so
what
does
omniscient
being
use
criterion
long
term
survival
human
species
what
how
does
omniscient
map
definitely
being
able
assign
right
wrong
actions
suppose
your
omniscient
being
told
you
long
term
survival
humanity
requires
us
exterminate
some
other
species
either
terrestrial
alien
now
you
letting
omniscient
being
give
information
me
part
original
premise
well
your
original
premises
have
habit
changing
over
time
so
perhaps
you
d
like
review
us
tell
us
what
difference
between
omniscient
being
able
assign
right
wrong
actions
telling
us
result
does
make
moral
do
so
which
type
morality
you
talking
about
natural
sense
all
immoral
harm
another
species
long
doesn
adversely
affect
your
own
i
guess
i
m
talking
about
morality
introduced
you
which
going
implemented
omniscient
being
can
definitely
assign
right
wrong
actions
you
tell
us
what
type
morality
