i
looking
rigorous
definition
because
otherwise
we
would
spending
rest
our
lives
arguing
what
christian
really
believes
i
don
think
we
need
argue
about
ks
do
you
think
motto
points
out
country
proud
ks
its
freedom
religion
something
ks
distinguishes
us
from
many
other
countries
mw
ks
well
your
opinion
shared
most
people
i
gather
perhaps
because
those
seeking
make
government
recognize
christianity
dominant
religion
country
do
think
infringing
rights
others
who
do
share
beliefs
yes
also
many
people
who
trying
make
government
recognize
christianity
dominant
religion
country
do
think
motto
infringes
upon
rights
others
who
do
share
beliefs
actually
i
think
government
already
does
recognize
christianity
dominant
religion
country
i
mean
don
you
realize
recognize
isn
say
we
supposed
believe
teachings
christianity
just
most
people
do
like
i
ve
said
before
i
personally
don
think
motto
major
concern
you
agree
me
what
we
discussing
ks
since
most
people
don
seem
associate
christmas
jesus
much
ks
anymore
i
don
see
what
problem
can
you
prove
your
assertion
most
people
u
don
associate
christmas
jesus
anymore
i
hear
quite
bit
about
christmas
little
anything
about
jesus
wouldn
figure
more
prominent
holiday
were
really
associated
high
degree
him
you
saying
association
jesus
personal
level
everyone
thinks
about
just
never
talks
about
can
you
prove
most
people
do
associate
christmas
most
importantly
jesus
anyways
point
again
people
who
do
associate
christmas
jesus
doesn
matter
people
majority
i
think
numbers
do
matter
takes
majority
least
majority
those
power
discriminate
doesn
