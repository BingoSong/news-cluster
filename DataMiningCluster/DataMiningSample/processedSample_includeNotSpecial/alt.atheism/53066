couple
things
about
your
post
others
thread
little
confusing
atheist
one
whom
all
things
can
understood
processes
nature
exclusively
definition
does
include
all
atheists
see
faq
however
i
one
do
think
need
invoke
any
divine
spiritual
explanations
makes
big
difference
claim
all
things
can
understood
natural
processes
claim
our
observations
do
require
us
postulate
any
divine
intervention
anything
spiritual
matter
humans
omnipotent
neither
science
however
science
has
one
advantage
theology
doesn
self
correcting
nature
its
judge
delightful
see
how
scientific
inquiry
revealing
self
consistent
simple
picture
our
universe
science
longer
bunch
separate
branches
one
from

physics
psychology
aspect
our
life
our
universe
safe
from
its
stern
stony
eye
even
our
consciousness
need
any
recourse
divnity
describe

anything
purpose
direction
any
event
beyond
those
required
physics
chemistry
biology
etc
everything
random
nothing
determnined
actually
determinism
vs
indeterminism
philosophical
question
science
cannot
say
whether
whole
thing
actually
somehow
superdeterministic
i
think
question
does
have
any
meaning
far
individual
human
beings
go
apparent
free
illusion
does
appear
so
from
perspective
bill
can
you
say
sure
whether
you
have
free
would
also
have
include
human
intelligence
course
all
its
products
nothing
requiring
life
evolve
acquire
intelligence
just
happy
accident
maybe
who
we
tell
seems
intelligence
useful
when
during
history
earth
has
one
species
been
able
control
one
third
whole
biosphere
can
still
result
numerous
happy
accidents
our
genetic
machinery
blindly
replicates
preserves
even
machinery
can
result
same
principle
only
systems
can
start
replicating
survive
those
which
don
don
make
recommended
reading
o
atheist
event
can
preferred
another
said
have
more
less
value
than
another
any
naturalistic
sense
thought
about
event
can
have
value
from
whose
perspective
i
value
events
things
subjectively
from
my
perspective
nature
does
have
values
because
does
have
perspective
values
arise
from
awareness
i
have
subjective
perspective
easy
assume
other
people
also
do
i
think
about
what
would
like
position
i
eventually
discover
golden
rule
morality
necessarily
gift
from
heavens
fact
may
product
evolution
perhaps
we
aware
ourselves
because
sense
identity
helpful
allows
us
play
roles
others
make
us
respect
others
who
seem
have
identity
too
bill
have
you
ever
read
aristotle
try
his
ethica
nikomakhea
sp
starters
how
can
atheist
judge
value
what
basis
criticizing
values
ennumerated
bible
purposes
imputed
god
what
grounds
can
behavior
reliogious
condemned
seems
judging
values
motivate
others
action
you
have
have
some
standard
against
which
conduct
measured
what
nature
can
serve
purpose
what
law
nature
can
you
invoke
establish
your
values
c
lewis
tells
us
argument
main
reason
why
he
abandoned
his
atheism
became
christian
argument
severely
flawed
some
values
golden
rule
can
have
rational
basis
some
others
like
basic
idea
wanting
live
has
probably
its
roots
way
our
brains
wired
lewis
ignored
very
real
possiblity
natural
selection
could
also
favour
altruistic
behaviour
morality
well
indeed
humans
evolved
better
better
building
using
tools
also
became
better
killing
each
other
logical
necessity
evolution
could
only
favour
those
who
knew
how
use
tools
against
one
own
people
bible
reveals
quite
nicely
morality
early
jews
beyond
simple
set
rules
hold
people
together
under
one
god
god
did
care
much
about
people
other
nations
time
nt
things
were
quite
different
jews
were
under
rule
empire
could
longer
simply
ignore
gentiles
new
situation
required
new
morality
along
new
religion
born
mutation
meme
pool
since
every
event
entirely
exclusively
physical
event
what
difference
could
possibly
make
what
anyone
does
religious
otherwise
can
meaning
gradation
value
only
way
atheist
can
object
any
behaviour
admit
objection
entirely
subjective
he
she
just
doesn
like
any
value
judgement
must
prefaced
disclaimer
nothing
more
than
matter
personal
opinion
carries
weight
any
absolute
sense
looks
like
you
haven
bothered
read
philosophy
whenever
observer
subjective
point

which
may
value
its
existence
happiness
even
were
just
result
some
physical

other

too
observer
comes
think
about
absolutely
objective
sense
without
any
observers
subjects
moral
judgments
lose
meaning
possible
value
simply
exist
without
point
view
includes
gods
too
values
only
personal
judgments
absolute
truths
since
truths
do
exist
fact
most
people
do
deliberately
want
hurt
others
manifestation
way
we
have
fought
our
existence
becoming
social
beings
who
can
think
value
others
existence

property
humans
alone
chimps
dolphins
many
other
species
show
great
care
each
other
dolphins
have
sometimes
saved
humans
from

good
deed
indeed
you
don
like
what
god
told
people
do
says
nothing
about
god
god
commands
says
only
electrical
event
your
nervous
system
created
emotional
state
your

your
objections
seem
well

way
you
ve
been
conditioned
truth
content
whole
your
intellectual
landscape
illusion
virtual
reality
last
statement
does
logically
follow
fact
every
reason
believe
our
thoughts
can
model
reality
very
well
our
senses
can
convey
reliable
information
solipsism
still
logical
possibility
very
likely
one
you
continuously
mixing
two
different
views
subjective
point
view
which
we
all
share
objective
point
view
which
does
exist
any
observer
thinker
any
personal
being
has
its
own
point
view
does
matter
whether
point
view
result
some
physical
events
does
cease
subjective
from
non
observers
non
point
view
values
do
exist
neither
does
pain
pleasure
beauty
love
things
inherently
subjective
once
again
god
wants
wives
submit
husbands
even
make
leap
faith
unknown
wants
punish
us
we
don
i
disagree
his
morals
i
do
think
my
morals
come
from
any
supreme
being
remove
my
morals
means
same
than
make
me
zombie
machine
without
single
thought
god
gave
us
morality
judge
i
disagree
him
my
fault
he
free
replace
my
morals
i
cannot
see
what
point
giving
someone
moral
system
which
disagrees
one
own
get
mad
god
must
schizophrenic
all
being
so
you
have
excluded
yourself
from
any
discussion
values
right
wrong
goood
evil
etc
cannot
participate
your
opinion
about
bible
can
have
weight
whatsoever
neither
can
opinion
any
god
matter
i
cannot
understand
why
subjective
opinion
thing
made
matter
any
way
less
credible
than
opinion
thing
made
something
else
bill
take
note
absolute
values
must
independent
any
being
including
gods
god
has
subjective
viewpoint
his
own
point
view
his
morals
his
own
