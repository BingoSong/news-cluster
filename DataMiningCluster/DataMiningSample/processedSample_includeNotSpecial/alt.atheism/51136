i
would
say
one
innocent
person
killed
some
sense
bad
many
we
certainly
feel
way
when
we
punish
someone
single
murder
now
we
reform
system
x
reducing
number
deaths
one
we
produce
system
xx
i
d
say
we
should
go
back
system
x
even
though
doing
so
we
would
re
introduce
only
single
extra
death
bob
seems
think
one
bad
many
sense
somewhat
stronger
than
one
you
indicate
yes
i
do
my
argument
sole
purpose
death
penalty
kill
people
primary
i
would
argue
only
purpose
continue
kill
people
practice
has
almost
utility
especially
when
you
know
you
killing
innocents
unconscionable
very
least
existence
prison
system
our
transportation
system
based
merits
society
detriments
we
willing
accept
few
lost
innocent
lives
because
overwhelming
benefit
continued
existence
systems
one
has
stretch
evidence
arguments
make
same
claim
capital
punishment
just
case
i
wasn
clear
again
we
maintain
capital
punsihment
system
kills
innocent
people
provides
us
net
positive
gain
why
were
you
pin
me

i
would
have

i
don
belief
