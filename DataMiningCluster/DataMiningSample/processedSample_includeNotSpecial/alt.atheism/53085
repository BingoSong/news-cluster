today
i
think
i

going
large
participant
its
daily
postings
i
liked
section
faq
about
constructing
logical
arguments
well
done
i
am
atheist
i
do
try
turn
other
people
atheists
i
only
try
figure
why

i
don
much

am
willing
admit
possibility
something
religious
followers
dont
seem
have
capability
do
welcome
aboard
i
notice
alot
posts
from
bobby
why
does
anybody
ever
respond
his
posts
he
always
falls
back
same
argument
i
think
you
just
answered
your
own
question
religion
followed
cause
bad
he
right
just
because
event
explained
human
have
been
done
name
religion
does
mean
actually
followed
religion
he
always
point
ideal
say
wasn
followed
so
can
reason
event
really
way
argue
him
so
why
bother
sure
you
may
get
upset
because
his
answer
blind
supported
factually
he
win
every
time
his
little
argument
i
don
think
any
postings
from
me
direct
response
one
his
most
responses
were
against
his
postings
spouted
fact
all
atheists
fools
evil
seeing
