do
women
have
souls
islam
people
have
said
here
some
muslims
say
women
do
have
souls
i
must
admit
i
have
never
heard
view
being
held
muslims
any
era
i
have
heard
some
christians
some
eras
holding
viewpoint
muslims
you
sure
you
might
confusing
christian
history
islamic
history
yes
supposed
have
been
predominant
view
turkish
caliphate
i
would
like
reference
you
have
got
one
news
me
anyhow
women
spiritual
equals
men
can
clearly
shown
from
many
verses
qur
example
qur
says
muslim
men
women
believing
men
women
devout
men
women
true
men
women
men
women
who
patient
constant
men
women
who
humble
themselves
men
women
who
give
charity
men
women
who
fast
deny
themselves
men
women
who
guard
chastity
men
women
who
engage
much
god
praise
them
has
god
prepared
forgiveness
great
reward
qur
abdullah
yusuf
ali
translation
other
quotes
too
i
think
above
quote
shows
men
women
spiritual
equals
thus
women
have
souls
just
men
do
very
clearly
does
implies
have
souls
does
say
have
souls
given
quote
above
given
high
priority
all
interpretations
one
must
approach
qur
intelligence
any
thinking
approach
qur
cannot
interpret
above
verse
others
like
women
men
spiritual
equals
i
think
above
verse
does
clearly
imply
women
have
souls
does
make
any
sense
something
without
soul
forgiven
have
great
reward
understood
after
life
i
think
usual
answer
would
which
case
part
saying
them
has
god
prepared
forgiveness
great
reward
says
have
souls
makes
sense
say
things
without
souls
can
forgiven
i
have
idea
what
soul
your
saying
quote
above
may
given
high
priority
all
interpretations
any
thinking
approach
qur
has
give
all
verses
qur
equal
priority
because
according
muslim
belief
whole
qur
revelation
god
fact
denying
truth
any
part
qur
sufficient
considered
disbeliever
islam
quite
similar
you
other
post
even
when
quran
does
encourage
slavery
justified
say
iit
forbids
puts
end
slavery
non
sequitur
look
any
approach
qur
must
done
intelligence
thought
fashion
one
can
try
understand
quran
message
book
finite
length
cannot
explicitly
answer
every
question
you
want
put
through
its
teachings
can
guide
you
i
think
however
women
spiritual
equals
men
clearly
unambiguously
implied
above
verse
since
women
can
clearly
forgiven
rewarded
must
have
souls
from
above
verse
let
try
understand
what
qur
trying
teach
rather
than
try
see
how
many
ways
can
misinterpreted
ignoring
passage
passage
misinterpretations
qur
based
ignoring
verse
verse
infinite

fully

more

let
try

rather
than
how
