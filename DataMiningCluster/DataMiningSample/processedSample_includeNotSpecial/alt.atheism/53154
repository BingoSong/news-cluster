re
islamic
genocide
o
k
so
pick
former
yugoslavia
instead
say
problems
caused
communism
doesn
really
matter
i
guess
religious
leaders
calling
end
too
so
can
religiously
motivated
despite
fact
christians
carve
crosses
dead
muslims
chests
maybe
just
want
land
maybe
its
something
else
want
maybe
cross
carvings
just
accidental
i
don
know
just
looks
suspicious
most
likely
tragic
situation
bosnia
combination
ethnical
religious
motives
where
religion
just
one
attribute
separates
groups
from
each
other
i
must
agree
sad
saga
bosnia
terrible
example
case
where
religion
helping
instead
used
weapon
against
other
humans
my
sympathies
mostly
bosnian
side
looks
like
serbs
oppressors
willing
use
even
christianity
weapon
against
former
friends
cheers
