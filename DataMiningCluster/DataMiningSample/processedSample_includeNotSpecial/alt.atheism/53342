i
think
many
reading
group
would
also
benefit
knowing
how
deviant
view
i
ve
articulated
above
which
may
true
view
khomeini
from
basic
principles
islam
from
point
ov
view
atheist
i
see
you
claim
khomeini
wasn
practicing
true
islam
i
m
sure
he
would
have
said
same
about
you
how
am
i
member
neither
group
supposed
able
tell
which
one
you
two
really
true
muslim
very
good
point
i
have
already
made
clear
claim
khomeini
advocates
views
which
contradition
qur
have
given
my
arguments
something
can
checked
anyone
sufficiently
interested
khomeini
being
dead
really
can
respond
another
poster
who
supports
khomeini
has
responded
what
clearly
obfuscationist
sophistry
should
quite
clear
atheists
less
susceptible
religionist
modes
obfuscationism
so
answer
your
question
only
way
you
can
judge
learning
more
about
islam
reading
qur
understanding
basic
principles
once
one
has
done
relatively
easy
see
who
following
principles
islam
who
acting
way
odds
islam
khomeini
attributing
superhuman
status
twelve
muslim
historical
leaders
variance
one
basic

islam
which
human
