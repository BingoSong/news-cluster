i
am
doing
research
atheism
part
which
involves
field
research
here
net
following
survey
directed
towards
all
readers
group
intended
get
data
about
basis
atheistic
belief
i
would
recommend
you
take
look
your
dictionary
alt
atheism
faq
files
notice
atheism
belief
system
what
common
all
atheists
belief
lack
belief
deities
i
cannot
imagine
how
anyone
could
do
research
atheism
without
paying
careful
attention
issue
first
all
i
ve
tried
structure
questions
can
answered
variety
ways
varying
amounts
detail
possible
give
succinct
answers
most
everything
enough
here
keep
most
you
typing
hours
i
m
sure
imho
poor
method
do
any
real
survey
although
i
m
sure
replies
might
keep
you
amused
hours
also
i
tend
use
lot
anthropological
buzzwords
like
belief
system
although
i
know
some
you
might
contend
you
don
have
any
beliefs
skeptical
towards
everything
i
understand
you
know
what
i
mean
think
buzzwords
abbreviations
rather
unweildy
phrases
required
get
precise
idea
across
i
do
know
what
you
mean
you
surveying
our
individual
philosophies
fine
strictly
atheism
atheism
just
another
godless
version
theistic
explanations
life
universe
everything
belief
system
could
hardly
called
philosophical
system
once
more
atheism
characterised
lack
belief
deities
do
twist
meaning
assume
we
have
some
kind
philosophy
we
all
agree
some
comments
your
questions
what
contact
other
atheists
have
you
had
before
after
during
your
conversion
atheism
certainly
your
involvement
alt
atheism
counts
how
have
net
discussions
affected
your
beliefs
i
would
also
like
hear
more
about
have
we
been
able
convert
anyone
you
convinced
your
beliefs
were
acquired
through
wholly
rational
means
proofs
non
existence
god
etc
perhaps
least
part
through
other
means
alienation
from
mainstream
religion
etc
question
contains
contradiction
terms
beliefs
cannot
acquired
rationally
could
would
beliefs
you
also
seem
have
rather
strange
ideas
how
people
become
atheists
those
who
alienated
from
religion
do
necessarily
become
atheists
just
think
very
little
about
religion
seems
requires
considerable
time
honest
inquiry
find
out
religions
actually
intellectually
dishonest
virtual
realities
those
who
have
never
had
beliefs
certainly
find
question
quite
odd
how
can
lack
belief
acquired
when
did
i
acquire
lack
belief
easter
bunny
i
did
believe
santa
though
what
extent
do
you
feel
you
understand
universe
through
your
beliefs
what
phenomena
universe
human
existence
anything
from
physical
phenomena
problem
existence
evil
human
affairs
do
you
feel
adequately
dealt
your
beliefs
where
lacking
explanatory
method
question
does
make
any
sense
since
atheism
does
deal
issues
worldview
philosophy
belief

sigh
why
