can
get
you
through
interlibrary
loan
i
shall
try
get
hold
when
i
have
time
read
course
short
dr
baucaille
began
investigating
bible
because
pre
ceived
scientific
inaccuracies
inconsistencies
he
assumed
some
problems
may
have
been
caused
poor
translations
gone
days
so
he
read
what
he
could
find
hebrew
greek
aramaic
what
he
found
problems
didn
go
away
got
worse
he
decided
see
other
religions
had
same
problems
so
he
picked
up
holy
qur
french
found
similar
prob
lems
many
so
he
applied
same
logoic

went
away
arabic
he
unable
find
wealth
scientific
statements
holy
qur
what
he
did
find
made
sense
modern
understanding
so
he
investigated
traditions
hadith
see
what
had
say
about
science
were
filled
science
problems
after
all
were
contemporary
narratives
from
time
which
had
pour
standards
primitive
world
view
his
conclusion
while
he
impressed
what
little
holy
qur
had
say
about
science
accurate
he
far
more
impressed
holy
qur
did
contain
same
rampant
errors

traditions
how
would
man

known
what
include
holy
qur
assuming
he
had
authored
so
short

stay
away

open
your
mouth
