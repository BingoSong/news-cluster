writes
first
i
want
start
right
out
say
i
m
christian
makes
sense
one
have
any
you
read
tony
campollo
book
liar
lunatic
real
thing
i
might
little
off
title
he
writes
book
anyway
he
part
effort
destroy
christianity
process
he
became
christian
himself
i
assume
you
posting
encourage
comments
how
much
history
has
tony
campello
read
much
seems
arguements
he
uses
i
am
summing
up
book
about
whether
jesus
god
i
know
many
you
don
believe
listen
different
perspective
we
all
have
something
gain
listening
what
others
have
say
good
hear
few
reasonable
christians
about
only
those
christian
scientists
would
take
note
australia
very
strong
movement
bunch
christian
scientists
who
believe
every
single
event
bible
exactly
true
rational
explanation
all
can
justified
using
laws
physics
example
few
chaps
who
trying
prove
age
universe
years
old
error
conventional
calculations
result
fact
speed
light
has
been
rapidly
decaying
over
years
has
been
accounted
book
says
jesus
either
liar
he
crazy
modern
day
koresh
he
actually
who
he
said
he
course
he
never
existed
bible
story
never
intended
become
manifesto
billion
people
did
tony
follow
one
up
some
reasons
why
he
wouldn
liar
follows
who
would
die
lie
wouldn
people
able
tell
he
liar
people
gathered
around
him
kept
doing
many
gathered
from
hearing
seeing
someone
who
had
been
healed
millions
people
have
died
lie
point
difficult
substantiate
since
well
defined
great
many
religious
arguments
work
way
consider
many
aztec
warriors
who
sacrificed
themselves
gods
belief
act
would
bring
them
victory
spanish
invaders
list
endless
aztecs
lost
btw
call
me
fool
i
believe
he
did
heal
people
perfectly
reasonable
grounds
me
anyone
become
christian
more
point
does
add
weight
claim
jesus
real
thing
niether
he
lunatic
would
more
than
entire
nation
drawn
someone
who
crazy
very
doubtful
fact
rediculous
example
anyone
who
drawn
david
koresh
obviously
fool
logical
people
see
right
away
have
you
ever
seen
documentary
about
rise
nazi
germany
more
point
did
tony
mention
one
could
hardly
call
werner
heisenberg
his
many
colleagues
fools
illogical
men
support
hitler
based
i
presume
upon
emotional
issue
rather
than
rational
agreement
his
principles
obviously
my
argument
invalid
tony
thought
hitler
sane
therefore
since
he
wasn
liar
lunatic
he
must
have
been
real
thing
hmmm
i
don
think
his
arguments
warrant
use
therefore
some
other
things
note
he
fulfilled
loads
prophecies
psalms
isaiah
elsewhere
hrs
alone
his
betrayal
crucifixion
i
don
have
my
bible
me
moment
next
time
i
write
i
use
unfortunately
what
alot
religious
discussions
i
have
had
people
result
quoting
bible
only
reasonable
way
i
think
people
can
look
bible
treat
stories
some
sort
metaphorical
representation
messages
authors
were
trying
present
someone
tries
interpret
parts
bible
literally
he
she
end
up
all
sorts
shit
tony
argument
would
perfectly
reasonable
people
who
believe
events
described
bible
took
place
convince
someone
who
thinks
bible
total
fiction
jesus
real
quoting
book
totally
pointless
example
mathematics
you
cannot
say
equal
b
because
equal
b
i
don
think
most
people
understand
what
christian
would
possibly
explain
why
have
so
many
people
being
killed
religious
wars
why
hundreds
different
versions
all
claiming
correct
certainly
what
i
see
lot
churches
rather
i
think
should
way
life
total
sacrafice
everything
god
sake
he
loved
us
enough
die
save
us
so
we
should
do
same
hey
we
can
do
god
himself
inspires
us
turn
our
lives
over
him
tuff
most
people
don
want
do
real
christian
would
something
strong
persevere
just
like
weight
lifting
guitar
playing
drums
whatever
takes
time
we
don
rush
one
day
christianity
your
whole
life
going
church
once
week
helping
poor
people
once
while
we
box
everything
time
units
work
time
sports
tv
social
life
god
above
boxes
should
carried
us
all
boxes
we
have
created
ourselves
i
think
you
posted
part
alt
religion
you
would
get
more
flames
than
here
i
have
never
really
understood
why
emotional
sentiments
stranger
should
interest
other
people
someone
famous
said
two
evils
life
polititians
churchs
one
rules
fear
living
other
fear
dead
i
am
pressed
i
could
probably
find
exact
quotation
cheers
