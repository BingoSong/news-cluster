first
i
want
start
right
out
say
i
m
christian
makes
sense
one
have
any
you
read
tony
campollo
book
liar
lunatic
real
thing
i
might
little
off
title
he
writes
book
anyway
he
part
effort
destroy
christianity
process
he
became
christian
himself
sounds
like
you
saying
he
part
some
conspiracy
just
what
organization
did
he
belong
does
have
name
book
says
jesus
either
liar
he
crazy
modern
day
koresh
he
actually
who
he
said
he
logic
alert
artificial
trifercation
many
other
possible
explainations
could
have
been
he
never
existed
have
been
some
good
points
made
group
impossible
jc
amalgam
number
different
myths
mithra
comes
mind
some
reasons
why
he
wouldn
liar
follows
who
would
die
lie
wouldn
people
able
tell
he
liar
people
gathered
around
him
kept
doing
many
gathered
from
hearing
seeing
someone
who
had
been
healed
call
me
fool
i
believe
he
did
heal
people
logic
alert
argument
from
incredulity
just
because
hard
you
believe
doesn
mean
isn
true
liars
can
very
pursuasive
just
look
koresh
you
yourself
site
he
has
followers
don
think
he
fake
have
shown
willing
die
giving
up
after
getting
shot
himself
koresh
has
shown
he
too
die
what
he
believes
far
healing
goes
i
rememer
right
healing
attributed
consistent
between
different
gospels
one
them
healing
done
any
more
faith
healers
can
pull
off
today
seems
me
early
gospels
weren
compeling
so
stories
got
bigger
appeal
better
niether
he
lunatic
would
more
than
entire
nation
drawn
someone
who
crazy
very
doubtful
fact
rediculous
example
anyone
who
drawn
david
koresh
obviously
fool
logical
people
see
right
away
therefore
since
he
wasn
liar
lunatic
he
must
have
been
real
thing
might
have
existed
any
number
things
logical
pitfall
those
who
use
flawed
logic
like
fall
bifurcations
tri
quad
etc
valid
because
proceeding
steps
person
shows
conclusively
alternatives
all
possible
once
everyone
agrees
given
set
indeed
all
arguments
among
alternatives
can
presentent
one
mostly
likely
true
can
deduced
excluding
all
other
possible
alternatives
however
can
shown
set
all
inclusive
any
conclusions
bases
incomplete
set
invalid
even
true
choice
one
original
choices
i
have
given
least
one
valid
alternative
so
conclusion
jc
real
mccoy
just
because
he
isn
one
other
two
alternative
longer
valid
some
other
things
note
he
fulfilled
loads
prophecies
psalms
isaiah
elsewhere
hrs
alone
his
betrayal
crucifixion
i
don
have
my
bible
me
moment
next
time
i
write
i
use
jc
rabbi
he
knew
what
those
prophecies
were
wouldn
any
great
shakes
make
sure
one
does
list
actions
would
fullfill
prophecy
what
would
compeling
were
set
clear
explicit
prophecies
jc
had
absolutely
knowledge
yet
fullfilled
them
anyway
i
don
think
most
people
understand
what
christian
certainly
what
i
see
lot
churches
rather
i
think
should
way
life
total
sacrafice
everything
god
sake
he
loved
us
enough
die
save
us
so
we
should
do
same
hey
we
can
do
god
himself
inspires
us
turn
our
lives
over
him
tuff
most
people
don
want
do
real
christian
would
something
strong
persevere
just
like
weight
lifting
guitar
playing
drums
whatever
takes
time
we
don
rush
one
day
christianity
your
whole
life
going
church
once
week
helping
poor
people
once
while
we
box
everything
time
units
work
time
sports
tv
social
life
god
above
boxes
should
carried
us
all
boxes
we
have
created
ourselves
here
i
agree
you
anyone
who
buys
load
mythology
should
take
what
says
seriously
what
says
must
total
way
life
i
have
very
little
respect
xians
don
myth
true
true
its
entirity
picking
choosing
i
see
lot
leaves
bad
taste
my
mouth
