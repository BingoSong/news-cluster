question
attitude
god
character
seems
awfully
egotistical
proud
christianity
tells
people
humble
what
deal
well
god
pretty
much
has
right
egotistical
proud
i
mean
he
created
you
doesn
he
have
right
proud
job
course
people
don
have
much
right
proud
what
have
accomplished
can
match
god
accomplishments
anyways

grumblegrumble
you
were
god
you
created
universe
wouldn
you
just
little
irked
some
self
organizing
cell
globules
tiny
planet
started
thinking
were
great
awesome
you
unfortunately
logic
falls
apart
quick
all
perfect
insulted
threatened
actions
lesser
creature
actually
offspring
how
why
shuold
any
all
powerful
all
perfect
feel
either
proud
offended
anything
capable
being
aware
relationship
every
aspect
every
particle
universe
during
every
moment
time
simultaneously
should
able
understand
cause
every
action
every
cell
globule
each
tniy
planet
well
actually
now
i
think
seems
kinda
odd
god
would
care
all
about
earth
ok
so
bad
example
amazing
fact
he
does
care
apparently
he
willing
make
some
grand
sacrifices
ensure
our
happiness
all
powerful
owner
everything
universe
makes
great
sacrifices
makes
great
headline
doesn
make
any
sense
what
did
he
sacrifice
where
did
go
he
couldn
get
back
he
gave
something
up
who
d
he
give
up
