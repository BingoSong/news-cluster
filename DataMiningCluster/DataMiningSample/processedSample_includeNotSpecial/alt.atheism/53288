you
sure
democracy
driving
force
behind
massacres
east
timor
certainly
odd
so
many
worlds
massacres
occur
along
religious
lines
independently
any
claims
democratic
form
government
ireland
northern
ireland
considered
democracies
would
you
attribute
problems
democracy
even
though
democracies
which
motivates
them
more
religion
democracy
mr
rice
pointing
out
fallacy
assertion
islam
evil
because
some
those
who
claim
follow
evil
asserting
democracy
causes
massacres
i
read
right
he
i
pointing
out
his
use
indonesians
killing
east
timorese
result
democracy
bit
weak
because
democracy
much
motivation
doing
much
anything
indonesia
from
what
i
remember
east
timor
former
portguese
territory
which
forcibly
annexed
indonesia
last
i
heard
over
indonesians
have
died
trying
keep
east
timor
part
indonesia
being
former
portuguese
colony
strong
catholic
influence
east
timor
i
recall
so
seems
bit
odd
yet
again
we
have
another
war
being
fought
between
people
who
just
happen
have
different
religions
purely
coincidental
i
guess
real
motivation
get
vote
out
make
democracy
work
indonesia
i
pointed
out
secession
movement
aceh
which
has
also
been
brutally
dealt
past
indonesian
government
harshly
all
secessionist
movements
evidence
appears
me
indonesian
government
has
dealt
very
harshly
all
secession
movements
i
know
head
indonesian
armed
forces
very
long
time
benny
murdani
christian
indonesia
has
been
heavy
handed
east
timor
long
time
even
when
murdani
head
armed
forces
people
who
make
up
indonesian
government
general
motivated
national
interests
religious
ones
