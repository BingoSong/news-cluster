argument
irrelevant
had
nothing

eh
mexico
we
have
invaded
mexico
times
once
century
were
missiles
anyone
shoot
over
here
time
hawaii

spain
so
you
mean
word
invaded
some
sort
military
action
where
we
cross
someone
border
you
right
out
normally
invaded
carries
connotation
attacking
autonomous
nation
some
nation
invades
u
virgin
islands
would
invading
virgin
islands
u
so
from
point
view
your
score
falls
out
mexico
panama
what
peace
nik
somebody
who
doesn
masturbate
over
guns
n
ammo
what
supposed
bad
peace
nik
someone
who
believes
peace
all
costs
other
words
person
who
would
have
supported
giving
hitler
only
austria
czechoslakia
poland
too
could
have
averted
war
one
who
would
allow
hitler
wipe
all
all
jews
slavs
political
dissidents
areas
he
controlled
long
he
left
rest
us
alone
supposed
bad
peace
nik
you
ask
well
depends
what
your
values
you
value
life
over
liberty
peace
over
freedom
i
guess
liberty
freedom
mean
more
you
than
life
itself
you
d
rather
die
fighting
liberty
than
live
under
tyrant
heel
yes
bad
peace
nik
problem
most
peace
niks
consider
those
us
who
like
them
bad
unconscionable
i
would
have
any
argument
problem
peace
nik
held
ideals
stayed
out
all
conflicts
issues
especially
those
dealing
national
defense
willing
allow
us
legitimately
hold
different
point
view
militate
many
times
resort
violence
all
name
peace
what
rank
hypocrisy
all
stop
we
warmongers
who
willing
stand
up
defend
our
freedoms
against
tyrants
who
realize
do
so
requires
strong
national
defense
time
get
off
soapbox
now
