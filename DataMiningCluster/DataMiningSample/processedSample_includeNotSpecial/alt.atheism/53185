we
worry
about
one
case
more
where
innocent
man
convicted
something
horrible
enough
warrant
death
penalty
hence
put
laws
place
which
make
virtually
impossible
actually
execute
real
criminals
death
penalty
serving
its
original
purpose
should
either
changed
done
away
i
don
have
numbers
back
up
so
take
following
accordingly
you
use
off
cuff
number
innocent
people
sentenced
die
acceptable
loss
benefit
capital
punishment
i
d
very
very
surprised
ratio
were
low
have
been
approximately
dozen
known
cases
execution
innocent
us
since
turn
century
have
we
same
period
sentenced
people
death
accounting
those
cases
we
don
know
truth
seems
reasonable
assume
twice
many
innocent
people
have
fact
been
executed
would
raise
number
death
sentences
metered
out
since
half
million
your
acceptance
ratio
hold
i
rather
doubt
case
point
course
what
acceptable
loss
seems
we
re
probably
doing
even
well
should
we
perhaps
find
better
solution

any
suggestions
what
better
solution
might
i
realize
off
hand
nature
numbers
i
used
i
can
answer
what
acceptable
loss
rate
however
i
said
another
post
i
despise
idea
supporting
criminals
life
economics
situation
concern
me
most
money
spent
feeding
clothing
housing
taking
care
people
who
have
demonstrated
unfit
live
society
could
go
number
places
all
which
i
probably
others
would
consider
far
more
worthwhile
which
would
enrish
lives
all
americans
give
people
jobs
give
homeless
shelter
any
number
things
clyde
little
girls
like
butterflies
don
need
reason
