have
request

like
see
charley

respond
charley
challenges

from
my
e

quite
few

clear
mr
wingate
intends
continue
post
tangential
unrelated
articles
while
ingoring
challenges
themselves
between
last
two
re
postings
challenges
i
noted
perhaps
dozen
more
posts
mr
wingate
none
which
answered
single
challenge
seems
unmistakable
me
mr
wingate
hopes
questions
just
go
away
he
doing
his
level
best
change
subject
given
seems
rather
common
net
theist
tactic
i
would
like
suggest
we
impress
upon
him
our
desire
answers
following
manner
ignore
any
future
articles
mr
wingate
do
address
challenges
until
he
answers
them
explictly
announces
he
refuses
do
so
you
must
respond
one
his
articles
include
within
something
similar
following
please
answer
questions
posed
you
charley
challenges
really
i
m
looking
humiliate
anyone
here
i
just
want
some
honest
answers
you
wouldn
think
honesty
would
too
much
ask
from
devout
christian
would
you
nevermind
rhetorical
question
