same
way
any
theory
proven
false
you
examine
predicitions
theory
makes
try
observe
them
you
don
you
observe
things
theory
predicts
wouldn
happen
you
have
some
evidence
against
theory
theory
can
modified
incorporate
new
observations
you
say
false
how
does
one
handle
nonrepeatability
experiment
many
types
experiments
prediction
observed
phenomena
happen
again
capable
being
observed
example
chemistry
someone
may
predict
outcome
chemical
reaction
actually
observe
reaction
repeatedly
several
problems
here
first
you
discussing
only
experimental
procedures
observational
procedures
also
useful
main
criterion
attempting
verify
idea
using
make
prediction
about
yet
unmade
observations
observations
could
result
experiment
could
obsevations
activity
occuring
spontaneossly
nature
could
even
observations
lasting
results
events
long
past
all
matters
observations
new
what
prediction
about
science
about
predicting
future
except
very
restricted
sense
secondly
repeatability
can
also
take
many
forms
really
just
requirement
independent
observers
able
verify
results
observation
fossil
repeatable
since
any
qualified
observer
may
look
why
specimens
reqtined
museum
also
implicit
prediction
future
fossil
finds
correspond
current
one
new
fossils
found
often
enough
tested
regularly
many
times
new
fossil
actually
falsifies
some
conclusion
made
basis
previous
fossils
unfortunately
you
models
were
falsified
have
alway
been
peripheral
model
evolution
we
now
have
instance
front
legs
tyrannosaurus
rex
turned
out
have
tremendous
muscles
rather
than
being
weakly
endowed
previously
believed
so
fact
histoircal
science
findings
repeatable
necessary
sense
just
becuase
you
cannot
go
out
repeat
original
event
does
make
impossible
make
valid
observations
say
biologists
would
go
coo
coo
extra
terrestrial
life
were
discovered
could
make
determination
process
abiogenesis
relatively
easy
