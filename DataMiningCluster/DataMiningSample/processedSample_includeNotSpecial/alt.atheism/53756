brutal
system
filtered
through
leniency
lenient
huh
how
do
you
rate
public
floggings
floggings
all
chopping
off
hands
heads
other
body
parts
what
about
stoning
i
don
have
problem
floggings
particularly
when
offenders
have
been
given
chance
change
behavior
before
floggings
given
i
do
have
problem
maiming
general
whatever
means
my
opinion
one
who
has
maimed
another
should
maimed
case
rape
victim
maimed
physically
emotionally
so
i
wouldn
have
problem
maiming
rapists
obviously
i
wouldn
have
problem
maiming
murderers
either
may
i
ask
you
had
same
opinion
before
you
became
muslim
sure
yes
i
did
you
see
i
don
think
rape
murder
should
dealt
lightly
you
being
so
interested
leniency
leniency
sake
apparently
think
people
should
simply
told
did
bad
thing
what
about
simple
chance
misjudgements
misjudgments
should
avoided
much
possible
i
suspect
pretty
unlikely
given
my
requirement
repeated
offenses
misjudgments
very
likely
orient
place
having
single
character
your
ignorance
exposes
itself
nicely
here
read
carefully
i
have
said
all
orient
shows
primitive
machism
well
why
use
more
specific
words
than
orient
probably
because
your
mind
need
all
same
because
contains
sufficient
information
while
more
detail
possible
necessary
europe
shows
civilized
bullshit
bullshit
time
put
out
shut
up
you
ve
substantiated
nothing
blabbering
like
islamists
who
talk
about
west
great
satan
you
re
both
guilty
stupidities
i
just
love
compare
lines
common
plea
your
fellow
believers
call
each
others
names
case
substantiate
quran
allows
one
beats
one
wife
submission
really
care
give
chapter
verse
we
could
discuss
primitive
machism
refers
i
have
misspelt
before
my
fault
again
all
orient
follows
qur
so
you
ll
have
do
better
than
sorry
you
haven
put
out
enough
islam
expresses
extramarital
sex
extramarital
sex
subset
sex
suppressedin
islam
marial
sexis
allowed
encouraged
islam
many
branches
christianity
too
misses
point
read
part
about
urge
sex
again
religions
run
around
telling
people
how
have
sex
my
piece
cake
two
reasons
suppressing
strong
urge
needs
strong
measures
business
anyway
believe
what
you
wish
i
thought
you
were
trying
make
argument
all
i
am
reading
opinions
argument
you
doubt
validity
premises
does
change
you
want
criticize
do
so
time
you
put
up
shut
up
argument
why
you
don
like
religions
suppress
sex
irrelevant
argument
you
d
like
generalize
objective
statement
fine
my
response
you
have
given
reason
your
statement
sex
business
religion
one
your
arguments
urge
sex
adolescents
so
strong
any
overly
strong
measures
required
suppress
urge
have
sex
so
strong
adult
adult
can
make
commensurate
effort
find
marriage
partner
