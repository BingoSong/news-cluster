writes
you
might
like
what
bernard
lewis
writes
about
label
him
zionist
discredit
him
etc
you
misrepresent
me
selim
hard
evidence
my
statements
about
his
lack
objectivity
presented
quite
clearly
book
orientalism
edward
said
edward
said
way
christian
muslim
i
think
he
pretty
much
objective
his
treatment
race
slavery
middle
east
since
he
clearly
distinguishes
between
slavery
under
islam
practice
slavery
other
countries
like
us
prior
civil
war
he
also
does
conceal
verses
quran
which
promote
liberation
slaves
what
he
doesn
i
don
think
nobody
can
deduce
from
verses
slavery
eventually
abolished
islamic
countries
now
you
might
rather
conveniently
blame
practice
slavery
muslims
facts
out
i
also
fail
see
relevance
claim
lewis
being
zionist
what
i
wrote
regarding
bernard
lewis
him
being
zionist
gives
him
political
motive
his
giving
misrepresentations
half
truths
about
islam
read
orientalism
edward
said
see
evidence
yourself
fact
i
may
post
some
here
isn
too
long
were
encyclopaedic
information
which
anybody
can
access
slavery
abolished
certain
dates
some
years
after
muhammed
cause
tensions
ottoman
empire
between
arab
slave
traders
government
etc
we
also
have
asu
library
volumes
british
documents
slavery
where
reports
documents
concerning
slavery
all
around
world
can
found
which
i
checked
some
incidents
lewis
mentions
so
i
don
think
ones
political
stance
has
anything
do
documentary
evidence
i
haven
read
lewis
article
so
i
can
comment
directly
upon
have
only
spoken
about
his
writings
general
so
far
his
political
motives
make
him
biased
writer
islam
his
anti
islamic
polemics
i
understand
often
quite
subtle
often
based
telling
half
truths
again
read
orientalism
edward
said
i
am
asking
you
take
what
i
say
trust
fact
i
am
urging
you
do
so
get
book
well
known
book
check
evidence
out
yourself
issue
i
raised
slaves
were
used
sexual
purposes
when
claimed
islam
prohibits
extra
marital
sex
i
wrote
prophet
himself
had
concubines
i
wrote
incident
which
prophet
advised
someone
who
did
want
his
concubine
get
pregnant
etc
which
contrary
notion
sex
procreation
only
other
words
claims
baseless
quran
hadith
slavery
reality
opposed
practice
some
muslims
opposed
islam
using
slaves
sexual
purposes
necessarily
opposed
too
i
seem
unsuccesful
getting
through
you
islam
advocating
slavery
slavery
existing
institution
th
century
advised
slaves
being
freed
good
deeds
etc
which
nothing
new
many
cultures
saw
good
thing
what
problem
here
i
can
argue
rightfully
slaves
were
discouraged
about
thinking
about
statuses
politically
quran
rewards
good
slave
so
obey
your
master
perhaps
one
day
you
ll
free
very
understandable
i
do
communicate
muslims
since
assume
quran
from
god
i
think
rule
based
system
imposed
society
preservation
status
quo
slaves
part
system
subordination
women
so
function
society
boils
down
child
making
part
system
etc
i
understand
your
point
view
selim
i
think
rather
us
who
getting
through
you
some
points
you
repeat
above
i
have
already
answered
before
regarding
women
i
have
made
posting
after
posting
subject
showing
islam
anti
woman
etc
however
have
you
been
completely
ignoring
my
postings
just
missing
them
i
just
reposted
very
good
one
under
title
islam
women
reposted
from
soc
religion
islam
has
already
disappeared
from
your
site
please
email
me
telling
me
so
i
email
you
copy
excellent
article
imho
your
understanding
issue
women
islam
sadly
deficient
regarding
slaves
my
posting
slavery
second
one
i
made
which
repost
article
i
wrote
early
last
year
based
completely
qur
contains
numerous
qur
anic
verses
hadiths
support
its
point
view
our
approaches
different
you
arguing
from
historical
standpoint
i
am
arguing
directly
from
teachings
qur
hadiths
now
just
because
people
say
muslims
perform
particular
action
does
automatically
mean
action
part
islam
even
opposed
qur
sunnah
course
let
me
give
you
concrete
example
which
might
help
clarify
you
qur
prohibits
drinking
now
person
says
i
am
muslim
proceeds
drink
bottle
beer
does
now
mean
islam
teaches
people
should
drink
beer
course
only
idiot
would
think
so
do
you
see
my
point
very
natural
think
author
authors
quran
had
idea
socio
economic
structure
were
advocating
would
experience
least
two
paradigm
shifts
years
western
cultures
first
end
feudal
era
rise
commerce
second
industrial
revolution
well
rules
have
changed
status
quo
has
driven
muslim
countries
misery
trying
survive
heathen
world
muslim
countries
have
failed
economically
were
unable
accumulate
any
wealth
directly
due
uncomprimising
economic
rules
quran
fact
rise
islam
can
easily
modeled
after
pyramid
effect
you
do
produce
any
wealth
home
increase
your
wealth
conquering
places
you
judging
islam
here
capitalist
terms
capitalism
ideology
based
largely
assumption
people
want
maximise
wealth
assumption
opposition
islamic
teachings
say
islam
bad
because
capitalist
pretty
unthinking
islam
does
pretend
capitalist
does
try
capitalist
does
mean
islam
does
support
free
market
does
general
other
parts
capitalism
which
opposed
islam
i
understand
when
stopped
you
i
were
left
bare
open
emperialists
devour
capital
industry
very
poor
social
services
education
level
muslim
countries
lowest
world
health
statistics
miserable
etc
one
can
postulate
numerous
reasons
your
theory
because
islam
secularist
capitalist
etc
etc
selim
i
give
you
clear
historical
example
show
you
fallacy
your
views
you
think
you
obviously
do
islam
lack
education
power
large
part
history
islamic
world
very
powerful
significant
section
history
islamic
world
foremost
sciences
so
say
islam
example
anti
education
completely
absurd
you
try
blame
situation
islam
history
shows
your
conclusion
false
instead
must
other
reasons
situation
you
blame
muslims
following
quran
i
blame
muslims
following
quran
well
selim
your
viewpoint
women
islam
makes
me
question
extent
your
knowledge
islam
i
really
think
you
knowledgeable
enough
able
judge
whether
muslims
following
qur
your
idea
baseless
from
historical
facts
poor
utopia
islamic
world
forefront
world
science
one
stage
yet
somehow
your
theory
following
qur
muslims
backwards
education
selim
your
thesis
anti
historical
you
conveniently
overlook
historical
fact
which
contradicts
your
theory
while
my
ideas
derived
from
social
economic
history
you
have
certainly
shown
you
have
merely
stated
so
far
seems
me
your
view
islam
being
anti
education
quite
contrary
history
you
so
convinced
your
views
makes
me
wonder
just
how
objectively
you
trying
look
all
my
solution
all
muslims
simple
cut
crap
i
think
selim
you
should
consider
taking
your
own
advice
get
facts
straight
here
too
work
hard
reverse
effects
years
ignorance
selim
you
have
conviction
your
viewpoint
yet
you
demonstrate
ignorance
only
islam
also
islamic
history
particularly
respect
muslims
being
leaders
science
till
about
so
i
think
yet
you
say
your
viewpoint
based
history
selim
i
remember
right
you
say
one
your
earlier
posts
you
apostate
from
islam
i
think
you
should
slow
down
start
thinking
clearly
about
issues
start
reading
some
our
postings
about
islam
rather
than
ignoring
them
you
so
