waco
i
need
get
something
my
chest
faith
dogma
dangerous
religion
inherently
encourages
implementation
faith
dogma
reason
i
scorn
religion
i
don
necessarily
disagree
your
assertion
i
disagree
your
reasoning
faith
bad

unfortunately
you
never
state
why
faith
dogma
dangerous
you
believe
faith
dogma
dangerous
because
what
happened
waco
you
missing
point
branch
davidians
made
mistake
confusing
message
messenger
believed
koresh
prophet
therefore
believed
everything
he
said
problem
wasn
religion
followers
didn
die
because
faith
dogma
died
because
zealotry
case
children
zealotry
parents
i
have
expressed
notion
past
some
christians
debated
me
whether
christianity
leaves
any
room
reasoning
i
claimed
rationality
quelled
out
christianity
faith
dogma
so
christians
totally
irrational
irrational
respect
religion
only
what
you
saying
one
belief
christian
god
does
make
one
totally
irrational
i
think
i
know
what
you
were
getting
i
d
rather
hear
you
expand
subject
philosopher
cannot
christian
because
philosopher
can
change
his
mind
whereas
christian
cannot
due
nature
faith
dogma
present
any
religion
again
statement
too
general
christian
perfectly
capable
being
philosopher
absolutely
capable
changing
his
her
mind
faith
god
belief
all
beliefs
may
change
would
you
assert
atheists
would
make
poor
philosophers
because
predisposed
believe
god
which
course
may
show
unfair
bias
when
studying
say
religion
i
claimed
christian
philosopher
christian
person
whose
beliefs
moment
correspond
those
christianity
consider
person
visiting
guarding
prison
prisoner
unless
you
define
prisoner
simply
someone
prison
can
we
define
prisoner
someone
who
moment
prison
can
we
define
christian
someone
who
moment
has
christian
beliefs
because
person
free
go
he
prisoner
similarly
person
constrained
faith
dogma
he
christian
so
christianity
prison
eh
ever
heard
parole
you
have
read
far
too
much
subject
christian
one
who
follows
religion
based
teachings
man
named
jesus
christ
nowhere
does
definition
imply
one
cannot
change
one
mind
prison
however
you
can
just
decide
leave
one
voluntary
other
two
compatible
religion
like
gun
doesn
kill
anybody
religion
encourages
faith
dogma
although
doesn
directly
condemn
people
encourages
use
just
because
thinking
just
because
thinking
kills
people
i
prefer
think
religion
water
pistol
filled
urine
seriously
though
some
certainly
all
religions
do
condemn
groups
people
common
target
infidel
curious
being
who
alternately
atheist

because
thinking
kills
people
