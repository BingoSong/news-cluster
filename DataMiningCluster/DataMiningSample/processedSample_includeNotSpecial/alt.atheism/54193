fascinating
atheists
argue
abortion
defend
homosexuality
means

insist
only
values
biological
condemn
war
capital
punishment
according
benedikt
something
contardictory
cannot
exist
which
case
means
atheists
i
suppose
i
would
like
understand
how
atheist
can
object
war
excellent
means
controlling
population
growth
capital
punishment
i
m
sorry
logic
escapes
me
first
you
seem
assume
all
atheists
think
alike
atheist
does
believe
existence
god
our
opinions
issues
capital
punishment
abortion
however
vary
greatly
you
were
attacking
views
particular
atheist
benedikt
i
presume
please
present
your
argument
do
lump
us
all
together
issues
let
start
abortion
personally
i
do
support
abortion
means
population
control
contraception
after
fact
however
i
support
right
any
woman
have
abortion
regardless
what
my
personal
views
may
because
would
arrogant
me
tell
any
individual
what
he
she
may
may
do
his
her
body
domain
legislators
should
extend
uterus
my
opinion
i
am
sure
many
atheists
theists
would
disagree
me
i
do
defend
homosexuality
means
population
control
i
certainly
defend
end
itself
i
think
most
homosexuals
would
angered
hear
anyone
characterizing
personal
relationship
nothing
more
than
conscious
effort
keep
population
levels
down
atheists
believing
all
values
biological
i
have
idea
what
you
re
talking
about
finally
issues
war
capital
punishment
atheist
can
object
either
one
just
easily
theist
might
you
seem
hung
up
some
supposed
conspiratorial
link
between
atheism
population
control
could
atheist
cause
you
were
referring
