can
god
uncreate

would
violate
his

which
he
cannot
do

after
all
i

which
statement
his
inherent
existence

cannot
exist
mentioned
above
he
must
very
omnipotent
what
do
you
mean
omnipotent
here
do
you
mean
omnipotent
god
should
able
do
anything
everything
creates
self
contradictory
definition
omnipotence
which
effectively
useless
descriptive
omnipotence
must
mean
being
all
powerful
being
able
do
anything
everything
let
me
illustrate
analogy
suppose
united
states
were
only
nuclear
power
earth
suppose
further
us
military
could
effectively
countered
any
nation
group
nations
us
has
power
go
any
country
any
time
any
reason
straighten
things
out
leaders
us
see
fit
us
would
militarily
omnipotent
suppose
further
us
holds
doctrine
philosophy
interfering
internal
affairs
any
nation
current
civil
war
former
yugoslavian
states
technically
scenario
us
would
have
power
unilaterally
go
yugoslavia
straighten
out
mess
effectively
us
could
intervene
without
violating
its
own
policy
non
interference
policy
non
interference
were
held
strongly
enough
would
never
question
would
ever
violated
effectively
us
would
limited
what
could
actually
do
although
had
power
do
whatever
wanted
us
would
simply
never
want
interfere
idea
would
beyond
consideration
its
leaders
given
inviolate
non
interference
policy
god
effectively
limited
same
sense
he
all
powerful
he
cannot
use
his
power
way
would
violate
essence
what
he
himself
i
hope
helps
clear
up
some
misunderstanding
concerning
omnipotence
