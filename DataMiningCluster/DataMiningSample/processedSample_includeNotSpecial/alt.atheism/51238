many
people
would
probably
think
especially
fanatics
propogandized
conflict
between
atheists
religious
many
would
get
impression
we
were
trying
outlaw
religion
we
contintue
try
remove
all
things
religious
reference
what
people
i
ve
asked
think
perhaps
you
would
right
you
said
fundamentalists
would
think
way
after
all
think
being
oppressed
when
allowed
oppress
however
you
have
shown
where
you
get
idea
many
people
would
probably
think
atheism
vs
religion
winner
take
all
far
i
can
tell
your
groundless
prediction
happen
you
haven
taken
account
propoganda
remember
you
asked
germans
before
wwii
jews
shoudl
slaughtered
would
probably
answer
after
propoganda
machine
rolled
through
least
some
were
able
tolerate
you
see
only
takes
small
group
fanatics
whip
up
general
frenzy
propoganda
machines
have
been
gear
over
number
issues
including
abortion
gays
look
some
things
have
happened
well
so
far
have
passed
one
amendment
which
currently
under
intense
scrutiny
have
failed
outlaw
abortion
which
prime
goal
issue
yep
seem
sooo
effective
sure
well
haven
managed
outlaw
abortion
due
possible
objectivity
courts
have
managed
create
quite
few
problems
people
wanted
have
abortion
could
create
similar
problems
us
could
worse
can
try
stop
abortions
blocking
clinics
etc
imagine
what
d
have
do
stop
atheism
besides
margin
error
very
large
when
you
only
talk
two
people
better
than
your
one
your
opinion
also
i
have
branched
out
informal
survey
up
over
half
dozen
now
what
have
said
were
you
questions
unbiased
keith
you
would
claim
my
questions
biased
minute
i
posted
them
because
answers
agreed
me
everyone
i
have
asked
about
possible
removal
motto
christian
portion
has
expressed
regret
about
its
loss
because
like
however
when
pointed
out
them
new
motto
works
none
have
expressed
desire
rape
murder
pillage
etc
which
you
have
basically
claimed
so
you
able
convince
them
individually
could
you
convince
whole
room
them
whole
nation
atheist
portion
i
know
some
around
here
have
all
expressed
disgust
motto
some
noted
being
harassed
christians
who
used
motto
try
seem
justified
all
would
see
gone
yes
i
d
glad
were
gone
i
ve
never
supported
however
i
think
minor
problem
can
easily
ignored
contrasted
what
could
happen
what
may
likely
which
christians
designed
motto
does
motto
say
anything
about
jesus
why
do
you
think
refers
only
christians
christians
wrote
christians
think
religion
right
all
others
wrong
therefore
why
would
include
other
religions
realm
being
correct
i
doubt
any
other
religions
were
meant
included
well
i
am
clear
religious
convictions
francis
scott
key
motto
can
attributed
him
least
clear
he
believed
god
surely
few
christians
think
you
say
i
don
think
most
do
do
you
think
all
christians
actively
despise
other
religions
most
i
have
met
haven
don
do
so
christian
i
have
queried
thinks
means
anything
them
only
them
why
ask
some
people
other
faiths
sorry
i
would
christianity
just
so
awfully
popular
around
here
suppose
you
could
ask
few
people
well
i
have
asked
hindu
moselem
few
jews
all
them
think
applicable
them
course
i
can
say
people
just
some
i
know
pretty
well
accurate
representations
faiths
always
good
idea
assume
were
dissenting
views
any
given
issue
you
assuming
all
views
were
same
nothing
leads
conclusion
without
evidence
contrary
i
doubt
were
dissenting
opinions
you
claim
were
provide
some
evidence
your
assertion
well
i
d
really
like
i
ve
tried
i
really
don
know
where
get
access
congressional
records
from
can
anyone
help
out
here
comparing
christians
nazis
interesting
only
sense
neither
can
probably
convinced
change
beliefs
again
motto
money
doesn
cost
you
anything
extra
however
you
abolished
motto
we
d
all
have
pay
have
all
dies
plates
redone
like
people
paid
before
get
them
changed
have
motto
them
you
now
need
show
good
reason
change
everything
again
also
i
doubt
use
th
same
plates
more
than
year
printing
would
make
easy
remove
motto
simply
make
next
year
plates
without
your
claim
evidently
have
pay
extra
somewhere
provide
some
evidence
assertion
so
you
saying
redesign
plates
each
year
anyway
your
whole
argument
conveniently
deleted
i
see
motto
somehow
costs
us
all
lot
money
just
correct
ones
i
read
didn
mention
anything
about
jesus
i
think
issue
concerning
distinction
between
religion
how
could
between
religious
religious
motto
refers
god
religious
motto
question
whether
only
christian
you
say
more
i
doubt
provide
some
evidence
assertion
say
religion
country
non
religion
ussr
what
most
those
quotes
were
about
some
included
all
atheists
general
well
i
don
think
any
quotes
although
i
seem
have
lost
them
mentioned
anything
all
about
jesus
advocated
religion
over
non
religion
specific
religion
mentioned
you
have
missed
point
i
said
motto
didn
say
anything
about
anyone
particular
motto
doesn
imply
anything
about
your
particular
beliefs
doesn
say
everyone
trusts
some
form
god
only
nation
whole
does
we
have
been
through
before
obvious
does
include
me
much
beyond
doubt
your
claim
again
motto
refers
more
than
christians
based
facts
christianity
says
all
other
religions
wrong
because
seems
motto
written
christians
i
doubt
your
claim
so
you
saying
all
christians
must
believe
all
other
religions
should
outlawed
just
because
think
wrong
silly
i
think
flat
earthers
wrong
i
don
advocate
banishment
based
idea
i
doubt
any
additional
expense
would
even
incurred
removing
motto
provide
some
evidence
your
claim
would
i
think
any
cost
would
insignificant
i
mentioned
slight
cost
because
you
said
motto
costing
us
lot
money
being
our
currency
disregarding
digression
other
motto
used
harassment
other
purpose
has
been
found
why
should
removed
well
mottos
general
don
really
have
purposes
i
don
think
should
removed
because
i
think
benefit
would
outweighed
consequences
do
you
know
what
vote
were
other
opinions
do
you
think
main
reason
motto
required
law
bother
atheists
do
you
think
what
majority
congress
time
had
mind
you
do
show
why
again
opinion
people
who
put
i
am
concerned
you
should
concerned
opinion
entire
congress
again
necessary
complete
majority
shared
purpose
confronting
godless
communism
motto
why
majority
put
general
public
probably
does
know
about
anti
atheist
intent
few
people
either
i
daresay
more
people
remember
than
time
when
key
wrote
anthem
do
remember
debate
surrounding
motto
do
remember
some
people
intended
message
against
atheists
why
don
you
include
your
little
survey
you
were
conducting
you
claim
here
scientists
would
believe
someone
claims
i
doubt
provide
evidence
your
assertion
what
should
i
ask
some
scientists
probability
something
einstein
said
about
relativity
worthy
i
mean
einstein
said
good
chance
right
least
time
courts
method
scientists
use
can
applied
i
need
agree
court
default
because
good
record
you
need
agree
them
all
time
you
would
certainly
think
decisions
would
good
evidence
favor
some
point
what
you
said
you
didn
agree
court
because
allowed
congress
attempt
make
amendment
prohibiting
flag
burning
you
don
realize
something
like
external
realm
court
power
how
can
i
confident
you
know
anything
about
court
powers
i
mean
you
don
know
how
court
works
how
can
you
participate
discussion
court
judge
can
go
speak
before
congress
still
you
ignore
abortion
gag
rule
you
make
your
claims
abortion
i
think
would
clearly
inappropriate
supreme
court
justice
testify
before
congress
during
consideration
constitutional
amendment
order
court
rule
something
case
usually
must
presented
mushrooms
flowers
trees
buildings
signs
whatever
analogy
same
just
because
something
i
might
find
offensive
present
doesn
mean
my
rights
being
violated
we
talking
about
something
put
people
keith
mushroom
one
caused
mushroom
exist
unless
you
re
finding
things
offensive
mushroom
farm
yes
some
mushrooms
can
planted
i
don
appreciate
mushrooms
my
pizza
either
case
motto
you
re
ignoring
harassment
which
only

motto
you
re
ignoring

along
