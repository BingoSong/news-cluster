i
m
speaking
from
jewish
perspective
where
bible
means
what
many
call
old
testament
where
interpretation
necessarily
raw
text
instead
court
cases
commentaries
traditions
passed
down
through
jewish
communities
seems
crux
me
you
judge
bible
according
long
line
traditions
interpretations
coming
down
current
day
rather
than
its
own
merits
cultural
artifact
course
correspond
more
closely
more
contemporary
values
how
bible
actually
being
used
today
shouldn
how
we
should
judge
most
people
use
scissors
cut
paper
shouldn
consumer
reports
test
scissors
paper
cutting
ability
even
though
scissors
may
have
been
designed
originally
cut
cloth
possibly
good
way
judge
use
bible
teaching
jewish
morality
today
hardly
seems
fair
claim
highly
interpreted
version
what
enlightened
its
times
attempt
extend
analogy
like
saying
original
scissor
makers
were
unusually
advanced
paper
cutting
times
even
though
only
ever
cut
cloth
had
never
even
heard
paper
i
m
arguing
bible
disgusting
though
some
history
depicted
modern
standards
however
history
full
similar
abuses
i
don
think
biblical
accounts
worse
than
contemporaries
possibly
ours
other
hand
i
don
know
any
reason
think
history
described
bible
shows
less
abuse
than
contemporaries
ours
complex
benign
moral
traditions
have
evolved
based
particular
mythic
interpretations
history
interesting
i
still
don
think
fair
take
long

interpretation
use
attack
condemnation
