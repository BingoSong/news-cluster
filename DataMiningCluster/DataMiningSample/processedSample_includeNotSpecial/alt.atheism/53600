i
agree
seems
crux
your
whole
position
isn
us
shouldn
have
supported
hussein
sold
him
arms
fight
iran
i
agree
i
agree
ruthlessly
hunting
down
those
who
did
do
we
did
sell
arms
hussein
done
deal
now
he
invades
kuwait
so
do
we
just
sit
back
say
well
we
sold
him
all
those
arms
i
suppose
he
just
wants
use
them
now
too
bad
kuwait
unfortunately
sitting
back
letting
things
way
correct
former
mistake
destroying
hussein
military
potential
we
did
right
move
i
agree
your
statement
reagan
bush
made
grave
error
judgment
sell
arms
hussein
still
happening
entire
point
only
last
month
john
major
hailed
great
victory
he
had
personally
secured
sale
arms
saudi
arabia
same
month
we
sold
jet
fighters
same
indonesian
government
busy
killing
east
timorese
all
very
well
say
oops
we
made
boo
boo
better
clean
up
mistake
us
uk
keep
making
same
mistake
do
so
often
i
can
believe
deliberate
suspicion
reinforced
fact
mistake
extremely
profitable
one
decrepit
economy
reliant
arms
sales
so
really
gulf
war
you
abhor
so
much
u
west
shortsightedness
selling
arms
hussein
which
ultimately
made
war
inevitable
right
i
thought
both
were
terrible
