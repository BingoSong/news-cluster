aaaahhh
tell
me
how
many
innocents
were
killed
concentration
camps
mm
hmm
now
how
many
more
were
scheduled
enter
concentration
camps
had
been
shut
down
because
were
captured
allies
mm
hmm
now
civilians
died
war
so
matter
what
you
do
civilians
die
what
proper
course
don
sell
bastard
arms
information
first
place
ruthlessly
hunt
down
those
who
do
especially
re
positions
power
mathew
i
agree
seems
crux
your
whole
position
isn
us
shouldn
have
supported
hussein
sold
him
arms
fight
iran
i
agree
i
agree
ruthlessly
hunting
down
those
who
did
do
we
did
sell
arms
hussein
done
deal
now
he
invades
kuwait
so
do
we
just
sit
back
say
well
we
sold
him
all
those
arms
i
suppose
he
just
wants
use
them
now
too
bad
kuwait
unfortunately
sitting
back
letting
things
way
correct
former
mistake
destroying
hussein
military
potential
we
did
right
move
i
agree
your
statement
reagan
bush
made
grave
error
judgment
sell
arms
hussein
so
really
gulf
war
you
abhor
so
much
u
west
shortsightedness
selling
arms
hussein
which
ultimately
made
war
inevitable
right
so
i
agree
