writes
much
though
might
fun
debate
capital
punishment
itself
probably
wrong
group
only
relevance
here
you
don
seem
able
tell
us
what
capital
punishment
actually
when
murder
when
you
tell
us
murder
wrong
you
using
term
you
have
yet
defined
well
i
ve
said
when
innocent
person
has
been
executed
objectively
murder
however
who
blame
another
question
seems
entire
society
sanctions
any
sorts
executions
realizing
risks
blame
probability
killing
innocent
person
shooting
random
air
probability
killing
innocent
person
when
state
administers
system
capital
punishment
so
when
you
do
either
you
know
actions
you
taking
sooner
later
result
killing
innocent
person
yes
also
probablity
you
kill
someone
doing
any
raondom
activity
presumably
you
had
isolated
yourself
totally
from
rest
society
because
driving
kill
people
airlines
people
continue
do
both
driving
flying
punishments
inflicted
unwilling
prisoners
courts
risks
we
take
upon
ourselves
willingly
i
argue
our
law
system
similar
risk
perhaps
innocent
person
punished
someday
we
work
prevent
fact
many
criminals
go
free
result
our
trying
prevent
punishment
innocents
our
own
driving
kills
someone
else
sure
moral
issue
i
know
least
one
person
who
involved
fatal
accident
felt
vey
guilty
afterwards
accidents
totally
expected
given
numner
vehicals
road
again
blame
society
i
m
what
you
said
you
were
saying
were
false
witness
resulted
innocent
person
being
convicted
killed
would
still
fault
state
since
did
actual
killing
i
just
commented
state
does
killing
does
depend
being
false
witnesses
how
could
state
does
killing
even
case
sincere
mistakes
yes
state
fault
case
state
can
only
do
so
much
prevent
false
witnesses
possible
so
what
you
trying
say
capital
punishment
always
murder
because
possibilty
human
error
invalidating
system
i
m
saying
capital
punishment
murder
period
because
other
because
involves
taking
human
life
my
definition
murder
i
make
appeals
dictionaries
objective
morals
okay
so
what
you
call
murder
question
whether
all
murders
wrong
you
saying
all
taking
human
life
wrong
matter
what
circumstances
we
society
decide
murder
someone
we
should
say
lists
our
reasons
doing
so
live
moral
consequences
we
should
play
word
games
pretend
murder
isn
murder
my
opinion
about
how
society
ought
run
basically
how
works
society
accepts
risk
innocent
person
murdered
execution
every
member
society
shares
blame
most
people
definitions
murder
include
some
sort
malicious
intent
which
involved
execution
we
were
trying
discuss
objective
moral
system
least
its
possibilty
what
ramifications
does
your
personal
system
have
objective
one
we
were
discussing
objective
moral
system
i
showing
you
you
didn
have
one
because
one
thing
you
were
incapable
defining
terms
example
murder
murder
violates
golden
rule
executions
do
because
allowing
all
society
implicitly
accepts
consequences
matter
who
innocent
victim
we
re
talking
about
reading
minds
we
just
talking
about
knowing
truth
yes
we
can
never
absolutely
certain
we
have
truth
court
systems
work
principle
knowing
truth
beyond
reasonable
doubt
sorry
you
simply
quoting
yourself
accurately
here
what
you
said
since
we
looking
totally
objectively
case
we
know
what
people
thinking
when
voting
execute
person
intent
malicious
unfair
execution
would
murder
what
you
doing
now
slide
another
claim
which
quite
different
jury
being
persuaded
beyond
serious
doubt
same
us
knowing
what
minds
beyond
serious
doubt
reading
minds
jury
would
certainly
tell
whether
conviction
moral
objective
system
only
absolute
truth
matters
jury
system
one
method
approximate
truth
twelve
members
must
convinced
truth
moreover
jury
which
comes
from
sufficiently
prejudiced
background
may
allow
itself
persuaded
beyond
serious
doubt
evidence
you
i
would
laugh
we
read
minds
people
we
would
know
conviction
unfair
would
perfectly
fair
we
could
read
minds
we
assume
would
fair
we
knew
absolute
truth
why
so
much
less
fair
your
opinion
we
only
have
good
approximation
absolute
truth
question
fairness
your
claim
which
i
have
quoted
above
claim
about
whether
we
can
know
fair
so
able
distinguish
capital
punishnment
from
murder
yes
while
we
could
objectively
determine
difference
we
knew
all
possible
information
we
can
always
determine
difference
our
flawed
system
i
think
our
system
almost
good
possible
still
isn
objectively
perfect
you
see
doesn
matter
we
know
fair
objectively
either
fair
now
huge
difference
we
can
read
minds
we
can
know
we
cannot
read
minds
we
can
know
nothing
difference
degree
fairness
what
we
can
know
what
we
know
has
effect
objective
system
i
think
possible
produce
fairly
objective
system
we
clear
which
goals
supposed
promote
i
m
going
waste
my
time
trying
devise
system
i
am
pretty
sure
does
exist
why
you
so
sure
i
simply
want
people
confront
reality
my
reality
remember
why
your
reality
important
case
reality
ideal
theories
apart
we
can
never
know
even
after
fact
about
fairness
justice
system
every
innocent
person
released
from
death
row
may
have
been
dozen
innocent
people
executed
hundred
none
all
we
simply
don
know
we
can
assume
system
fairly
decent
least
most
likely
you
realize
correctness
our
system
says
nothing
about
totally
ideal
objective
system
now
what
we
going
do
one
hand
we
can
pretend
we
have
ideal
theory
we
can
know
things
we
can
never
know
justie
system
fair
we
can
wave
magic
wand
make
certain
types
killing
murder
go
our
way
well
we
can
have
ideal
system
working
system
can
ideal
we
can
only
hope
create
system
close
approximation
ideal
system
possible
other
hand
we
can
recognize
all
justice
has
small
we
hope
probability
punishing
innocent
end
we
do
bear
moral
responsibility
even
probabilistic
consequences
systems
we
set
up
say
well
here
we
go
murdering
again
maybe
some
us
even
say
gee
i
wonder
all
strictly
necessary
yes
we
all
bear
responsibility
most
people
seem
willing
do
i
think
second
preferable
requires
people
face
moral
consequences
what
we
do
society
instead
sheltering
ourselves
from
them
magic
ceremonies
word
games
we
must
realize
consequences
all
our
actions
why
do
you
keep
separating
justice
system
from
pack
lest
i
forget
i
also
don
think
we
have
objective
moral
system
i
believe
i
only
have
take
idea
seriously
when
someone
presents
evidence
i
don
think
our
country
has
objective
system
i
think
objective
system
can
exist
theory
without
omniscience
objective
system
possible
