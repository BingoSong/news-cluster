post
mine
also
illustrates
i
am
simply
reactionary
who
hates
any
book
which
doesn
go
out
its
way
avoid
upsetting
religionists
only
those
you
haven
actually
read
sorry
irony
remains
i
reiterate
nth
time
also
i
don
agree
k
fatwa
nor
do
i
support
censorship
my
point
original
thread
has
been
show
why
rushdie
particularly
due
sympathy
those
who
hold
religion
high
esteem
don
enjoy
seeing
things
which
slander
like
story
satanic
verses
opposed
rushdie
tsv
played
amusement
so
although
you
don
agree
fatwa
apparently
don
think
rushdie
should
killed
his
book
yet
you
think
he
due
sympathy
being
being
under
threat
furthermore
you
base
reaction
solely
fact
he
wrote
about
particular
well
known
story
which
true
might
reflect
poorly
absolute
truth
your
religion
yet
opinion
formed
without
recourse
actually
looking
see
how
story
used
context
accepting
face
value
widespread
propaganda
just
what
book
contains
what
author
motivations
you
come
forward
recommend
another
book
which
touches
presumably
plays
religious
historical
material
because
you
find
its
overall
presentation
neutral
