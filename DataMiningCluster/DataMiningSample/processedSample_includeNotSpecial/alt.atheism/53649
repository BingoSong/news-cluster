what
i
ve
been
following
train
talk
question
dismissing
atoms
being
some
sense
real
leaves
me
uneasy
seems
implied
we
obseve
only
effects
therefore

light
which
bounces
off
tree
itself
observation
indirect
more
so
than
observations
i
have
made
atoms
also
what
about
observations
experiments
have
been
routinely
done
individual

effect
where
individual
atom
studied
long
period
time
some
attempts
quantum
mechanical
arguments
were
very
satisfying
either
one
has
carefull
about
making
arguments
without
solid
technical
background
field
what
i
read
seemed
little
confused
quite
red
herring
anyway
purpose
public
debate
make
audience
think
worked
after
doing
so
i
m
willing
try
defend
following
assertion
anyone
cares
atoms
real
trees
real

day
sense
word
real
