you
re
going
claim
something
up
you
prove
think
cold
fusion
well
i
ve
provided
examples
show
trend
general
you
others
have
provided
some
counterexamples
mostly
ones
surrounding
mating
practices
etc
i
don
think
few
cases
enough
disprove
general
trend
natural
morality
again
mating
practices
need
reexamined
so
what
you
re
saying
your
mind
made
up
you
ll
just
explain
away
any
differences
being
statistically
insignificant
try
find
immoral
non
mating
related
activities
so
you
re
excluding
mating
related
activities
from
your
natural
morality
mating
practices
special
case
i
ll
have
think
about
some
more
so
you
ll
just
explain
away
any
inconsistancies
your
theory
being
special
case
yes
i
think
natural
system
can
objectively
deduced
goal
species
propogation
mind
i
am
equating
two
you
so
think
objective
system
isn
necessarily
natural
one
you
you
man
who
wrote
natural
moral
system
objective
moral
system
most
animals
follow
indeed
while
natural
system
objective
all
objective
systems
natural
one
so
terms
can
equated
natural
system
subset
objective
ones
you
just
equated
them
re
read
your
own
words
now
since
homosexuality
has
been
observed
most
animals
including
birds
dolphins
you
going
claim
most
animals
have
capacity
being
immoral
i
don
claim
homosexuality
immoral
isn
harmful
although
isn
helpful
either
mating
process
when
you
say
homosexuality
observed
animal
kingdom
don
you
mean
bisexuality
study
release
found
female
seagulls
lesbians
well
i
m
saying
goals
inherent
why
must
postulates
because
really
way
determine
them
otherwise
although
could
argued
arise
from
natural
goal
somewhat
removed
postulate
assume
posit
right
goals
themselves
aren
inherent
i
can
create
theory
postulate
sun
revolves
around
earth
moon
actually
made
green
cheese
stars
portions
angels
intrudes
three
dimensional
reality
you
could
would
contradict
observations
now
apply
last
sentence
your
your
theory
notice
how
your
contridicting
observations
i
can
build
mathematical
proof
postulate
given
length
one
side
triangle
length
second
side
triangle
degree
angle
connecting
them
i
can
determine
length
third
side
postulate
something
generally
always
found
true
i
don
think
your
postulate
would
valid
you
don
know
much
math
do
you
ability
use
sas
determine
length
third
side
triangle
fundemental
geometry
guess
which
one
people
going
more
receptive
order
assume
something
about
your
system
you
have
able
show
your
postulates
work
yes
i
think
goals
survival
happiness
do
work
you
think
don
good
goals
goals
postulates
again
