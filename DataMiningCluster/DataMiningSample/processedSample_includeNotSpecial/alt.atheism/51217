interesting
you
should

argument
from
incredulity
has
been
considered
valid
form
reasoning
since
medieval

i
quite
agree
why
do
some
atheists
here
engage
more
than
few
times
i
have
read
posts
where
atheists
posting
state
cannot
see
how
gracious
loving
god
can
allow
evil
suffering
occur
we
see
earth
simply
because
cannot
envision
must
true
argument
from
incredulity
i
don
know
what
you
have
presented
indeed
argument
from
incredulity
however
from
what
i
have
seen
often
presented
manner
usually
presented
more
form
besides
i
cannot
see
nor
have
i
ever
been
offered
convincing
explanation
moreover
unreasonable
ask
explanation
phenomena
theism
does
provide
convincing
explanation
argument
theism
favor
especially
when
different
theisms
offer
different
explanations
even
different
adherents
what
purportedly
same
theism
give
different
explanations
god
has
far
more
complex
motivations
reasons
action
non
action
than
simply
fix
evil
whenever
however
occurs
even
before
occurs
yet
very
same
argument
from
incredulity
which
ranks
high
among
reasons
why
atheists
general
reject
god
particular
christian
god
im
my
experience
my
experience
most
common

oh
heck
