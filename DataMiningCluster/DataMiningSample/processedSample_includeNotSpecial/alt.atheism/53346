i
think
many
reading
group
would
also
benefit
knowing
how
deviant
view
i
ve
articulated
above
which
may
true
view
khomeini
from
basic
principles
islam
from
point
ov
view
atheist
i
see
you
claim
khomeini
wasn
practicing
true
islam
i
m
sure
he
would
have
said
same
about
you
how
am
i
member
neither
group
supposed
able
tell
which
one
you
two
really
true
muslim
easy
just
read
koran
because
koran
perfect
possibility
disagreement
okay
i
see
smilies
so
isn
supposed
serious
post
other
hand
i
would
suppose
does
has
some
motivation
behind
apparently
idea
poke
fun
religion
presumably
some
sort
reasoning
behind
argument
statement
worthless
presuming
qur
perfect
religious
text
whatever
might
still
plenty
room
disagreement
about
its
implications
issues
far
from
essentials
i
ve
already
responded
question
how
judgment
might
made
between
two
people
who
fact
do
disagree
about
islam
which
doesn
presume
anything
about
qur
other
than
its
having
sufficient
clarity
all
important
disputes
about
basic
principles
islam
hardly
constitutes
claim
two
people
could
have
disagreements
about
all
issues
relevant
islam
