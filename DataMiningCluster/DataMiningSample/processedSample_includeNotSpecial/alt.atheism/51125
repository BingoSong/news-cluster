good
deal
more
confusion
here
you
started
off
assertion
some
objective
morality
you
admit
here
you
finished
up
recursive
definition
murder
objectively
immoral
eactly
what
murder
what
itself
requires
appeal
morality
yes
now
you
have
switch
targets
little
only
little
now
you
asking
what
goal
what
do
you
mean
goal
you
suggesting
some
objective
goal
out
somewhere
we
form
our
morals
achieve
well

goal
natural
morality
survival
propogation
species
another
example
moral
system
presented
within
declaration
independence
which
states
we
should
guaranteed
life
liberty
pursuit
happiness
you
see
have
moral
system
we
must
define
purpose
system
we
shall
moral
unto
what
end
murder
certainly
violation
golden
rule
i
thought
i
had
defined
murder
intentional
killing
non
murderer
against
his
you
responded
asking
whether
execution
innocent
person
under
our
system
capital
punishment

i
fail
see
what
has
do
anything
i
never
claimed
our
system
morality
objective
one
i
thought
your
very
first
claim
some
kind
objective
morality
example
murder
wrong
you
don
want
claim
any
more
fine
well
murder
violates
golen
rule
which
certainly
pillar
most
every
moral
system
however
i
am
assuming
our
current
system
manner
its
implementation
objectively
moral
i
think
very
good
approximation
we
can
perfect
way
you
don
seem
understand
difference
between
arbitrary
objective

livesey
may
still
say
well
according
my
personal
system

all

murder
wrong
what
legal
definition
murder
may

matters
whit
me
well
objective
would
