questions
after
claiming
all
atheists
fit
neat
psychological
patterns
you
proposed
semi
retracting
claim
stating
you
weren
referring
all
atheists
i
asked
you
name
some
atheists
who
you
feel
don
fit
your
patterns
show
you
indeed

you
however
deleted
text
further
along
where
i
said
i
didn
mean
imply
everybody
experience
along
same
lines
whether
you
mean
make
implications
you
do
so
repeatedly
allow
me
approach
issue
from
another
viewpoint
can
you
name
those
atheists
you
ve
come
across
who
do
fit
patterns
you
theorize
you
have
taken
umbrage
statements
effect
senses
reason
all
we
have
go
when
pressed
you
have
implied
we
have
alternative
called
revelation
i
have
repeatedly
asked
you
explain
what
revelation
how
one
can
both
experience
interpret
revelation
without
doing
so
via
our
senses
reason
you
failed
do
so
please
do
so
now
question
can
you
explain
what
revelation
how
one
can
experience
interpret
without
using
senses
inherent
reasoning
here
context
question
revelation
reason
we
do
have
revelation
reasoning
all
we
have
first
show
me
revelation
exists
second
revelation
perceived
through
senses
how
exactly
perceived
according
my
webster
revelation
act
revealing
communicating
divine
truth
now
tell
me
how
thing
can
revealed
communicated
other
than
via
senses
tell
me
how
you
can
interpret
revelation
other
than
reason
using
your
brain
interpret
what
you
sensing
when
i
say
way
human
being
interface
universe
other
than
via
senses
interpreted
reason
your
brain
because
simple

our
entire
interface
universe
our

me
otherwise
later
few
mystics
agree
assertion
common
defense
redefining

than
others
i
allow
you
broadest
definition
senses
make
things
easier
you
now
show
me
mystical
experiences
