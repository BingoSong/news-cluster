i
wonder
how
many
atheists
out
care
speculate
face
world
atheists
were
majority
rather
than
minority
group
population
probably
we
would
have
much
same
problems
only
slight
shift
emphasis
weekends
might
so
inviolate
more
common
work
days
week
business
instead
american
atheists
we
would
have
similar
religious
organizations
persons
religious
belief
seems
more
crutch
justification
actions
than
guide
determine
actions
course
people
would
have
come
up
more
fascinating
rationalizations
actions
could
fun
watch
seems
me
most
people
religion
america
doesn
matter
much
you
have
extreemists
both
ends
large
majority
don
make
too
much
issue
about
long
you
don
now
admittedly
i
have
never
had
suffer
bible
belt
i
am
just
north
see
fringes
reasonable
people
most
things
tend
reasonable
religion
well
also
how
many
atheists
out
would
actually
take
stance
accor
higher
value
way
thinking
over
theistic
way
thinking
typical
selfish
argument
would
both
lines
thinking
evolved
from
same
inherent
motivation
so
one
intrinsically
different
from
other
qualitatively
again
measuring
stick
must
drawn
somewhere
we
cannot
assign
value
system
beliefs
its
core
than
only
other
alternative
apply
its
periphery
ie
how
expresses
its
own
selfishness
i
don
bother
according
higher
value
my
thinking
just
about
anybodys
thinking
i
don
want
fall
trap
because
you
do
start
you
decide
which
better
says
whom
why
best
also
what
do
about
those
who
have
inferior
modes
thinking
idic
infinite
diversity
infinite
combinations
i
ll
argue
over
soda
over
much
more
just
my
what
inflation
has
done
