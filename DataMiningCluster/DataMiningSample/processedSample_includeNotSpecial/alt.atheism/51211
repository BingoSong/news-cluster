what
god
did
create
life
according
protein
code
which
mutable
can
evolve
without
delving
deep
discussion
creationism
vs
evolutionism
god
created
original
genetic
code
perfect
without
flaw
do
you
have
any
evidence
code
once
perfect
has
degraded
ever
since
we
should
have
some
evidence

statement
shouldn
we
perhaps
biggest
imperfection
code
full
non

introns
which
so
called
because
intervene
coding

exons
impressive
amount
evidence
suggests
introns
very
ancient
origin
likely
early
exons
represented

protein

number
introns
decreasing

appears
intron

occur
species

quite
similar

genes
other
hand
possibility
introns
have
been
inserted
later
presents
several
logical
difficulties
introns
removed
splicing
mechanism
would
have
present
unused
introns
inserted
moreover
intron
insertion
would
have
required
precise
targeting
random
insertion
would
tolerated
since
sequences
intron
removal
self

conserved
besides

duplications

i
seriously
recommend
reading
textbooks
molecular
biology
genetics
before
posting
theological
arguments
like
try
watson
molecular
biology
gene
darnell
lodish
baltimore
molecular

cell
starters
remember
question
posed
theological
context
why
does
god
cause
disease
newborns
my
answer
likewise
from
theological
perspective
my
own
less
valid
than
purely
scientific
perspective
just
different
scientific
perspective
supported
evidence
whereas
theological
perspectives
often
fail
fulfil
criterion
i
think
you
misread
my
meaning
i
said
god
made
genetic
code
perfect
doesn
mean
perfect
now
has
certainly
evolved
since
worse
would
you
please
cite
few
references
support
your
assertion
your
assertion
less
valid
than
scientific
perspective
unless
you
support
some
evidence
fact
has
been
claimed
parasites
diseases
perhaps
more
important
than
we
ve
thought
instance
sex
might
have
evolved
defence
against
parasites
view
supported
computer
simulations
evolution
eg
tierra
perhaps
i
thought
higher
energy
rays
like
x
rays
gamma
rays
cosmic
rays
caused
most
damage
fact
thermal
energy
does
most
damage
although
usually
mild
easily
fixed
enzymatic
action
actually
neither
us
knows
what
atmosphere
like
time
when
god
created
life
according
my
recollection
most
biologists
do
claim
life
began
billion
years
ago
after
all
would
only
half
billion
years
so
after
earth
created
would
still
too
primitive
support
life
i
seem
remember
figure
more
like
billion
years
ago
origination
life
earth
anyone
better
estimate
i
d
replace
created
formed
since
need
invoke
any
creator
earth
can
formed
without
one
most
recent
estimates
age
earth
range
between
billion
years
earliest
signs
life
true
fossils
organic
stromatolite
like
layers
date
back
billion
years
would
leave
more
than
billion
years
first
cells
evolve
i
m
sorry
i
can
give
any
references
based
course
evolutionary
biochemistry
i
attended
here
dominion
great
feat
satan
genetically
engineer
diseases
both
bacterial
viral
genetic
although
forces
natural
selection
tend
improve
survivability
species
degeneration
genetic
code
tends
more
than
offset
again
do
you
want
true
do
you
have
any
evidence
supposed
degeneration
i
can
understand
scott
reaction
excuse
me
so
far
fetched
i
know
you
must
jesting
do
you
know
what
pathogens
do
you
know
what
point
mutations
do
you
know
everything
can
come
about
spontaneously
response
your
last
statement
neither
do
you
you
may
very
well
believe
accept
fact
you
cannot
know
i
hope
you
don
forget
we
have
evidence
suggests
everything
can
come
about
spontaneously
do
you
have
evidence
against
conclusion
science
one
does
have
believe
anything
healthy
sign
doubt
disbelieve
right
path
walk
take
look
evidence
you
do
so
present
one
own
conclusions
prior
theology
does
use
method
therefore
i
seriously
doubt
could
ever
come
right
conclusions
human
dna
being
more
complex
tends
accumulate
errors
adversely
affecting
our
well
being
ability
fight
off
disease
while
simpler
dna
bacteria
viruses
tend
become
more
efficient
causing
infection
disease
bad
combination
hence
we
have
newborns
suffer
from
genetic
viral
bacterial
diseases
disorders
you
supposing
purpose
valid
move
bacteria
viruses
do
exist
cause
disease
just
another
manifests
general
principle
evolution
only
replication
saves
replicators
from
degradiation
we
just
efficient
method
our
dna
survive
replicate
less
efficient
methods
didn
make
present
last
time
please
present
some
evidence
your
claim
human
dna
degrading
through
evolutionary
processes
some
people
have
claimed
opposite
true
we
have
suppressed
our
selection
thus
bound
degrade
i
haven
seen
much
evidence
either
claim
i
ask
so
where
relevant
my
discussion
answering
john
question
why
why
genetic
diseases
why
so
many
bacterial
viral
diseases
which
require
babies
develop
antibodies
god
fault
original
question
i
say
course
nothing
evil
god
fault
your
explanation
does
work
fails
miserably
you
may
right
fact
you
don
know
satan
responsible
neither
do
i
suppose
powerful
evil
being
like
satan
exists
would
inconceivable
he
might
responsible
many
ills
affect
mankind
i
don
think
so
he
could
have
done
much
better
job
pun
intended
problem
seems
satan
necessary
explain
any
diseases
just
inevitable
any
product
evolution
did
i
say
where
seems
me
like
another
bad
inference
actually
what
you
ve
done
oversimplify
what
i
said
point
your
summary
my
words
takes
new
context
i
never
said
people
meant
presumably
god
punished
getting
diseases
why
i
did
say
free
moral
choices
have
attendent
consequences
mankind
chooses
reject
god
people
have
done
since
beginning
should
expect
god
protect
them
from
adverse
events
entropic
universe
i
am
expecting
god
exists
i
expect
him
leave
us
alone
i
would
also
like
hear
why
do
you
believe
your
choices
indeed
free
interesting
philosophical
question
answer
clear
cut
seems
what
consequences
would
you
expect
from
rejecting
allah
oh
i
admit
perfect
yet
i
m
working
good
library
bookstore
good
starting
point
what
does
have
do
price
tea
china
question
which
i
provided
answer
biology
genetics
fine
subjects
important
scientific
endeavors
explain
how
god
created
set
up
life
processes
don
explain
why
behind
creation
life
its
subsequent
evolution
why
why
behind
your
proposition
something
supported
evidence
why
we
recommend
books
any
need
invoke
any
why
behind
prime
mover
evidence
whole
universe
can
come
existence
without
any
intervention
recent
cosmological
theories
hawking
et
al
suggest
why
do
people
still
insist
thanks
scotty
your
fine
sagely
advice
i
am
highly
motivated
learn
all
nitty
gritty
details
biology
genetics
although
i
m
sure
i
d
find
fascinating
subject
i
realize
details
do
change
big
picture
god
created
life
beginning
ability
change
adapt
its
environment
i
m
sorry
do
evidence
your
big
picture
need
create
anything
capable
adaptation
can
come
existence
without
supreme
being
