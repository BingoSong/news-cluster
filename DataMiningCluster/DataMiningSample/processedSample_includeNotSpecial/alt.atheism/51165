bobby
states
satan
has
free
he
does
god
wants
him
brings
up
host
paradoxes
god
therefore
evil
do
i
have
free
god
directing
me
also
god
evil
which
part
his
infinite
self
good
which
evil
etc
i
would
like
once
solid
answer
run
about
i
hope
i
gave
you
fairly
solid
answer
one
i
simply
don
agree
embodied
version
satan
who
separate
creation
force
i
wrote
belief
which
i
ascribe
evil
creation
rather
absence
good
fits
all
logic
about
things
having
dual
use
e
g
knife
can
used
sculpt
can
used
kill
like
entropy
evil
seen
view
neither
force
nor
entity
satan
therefore
metaphorical
fact
several
verses
holy
qur
which
appear
support
view
several
traditions
well
example
tradition
food
should
never
left
open
shelf
table
overnight
lest
satan
enter
appears
reference
yet
undiscovered
germs
thus
evil
effect
spoiled
food
described
satan
many
examples
satan
personified
which
am
i
believe
quite
physical
descriptions
heaven
hell
holy
qur
bible
etc
have
been
times
spiritual
intellectual
evolution
modern
human
when
physical
descriptions
heaven
hell
satan
were
taken
quite
literally
worked
time
i
mentioned
tradition
cited
above
example
sufficient
absence
theory
about
germs
disease
spread
worms
simply
describe
evil
which
passed
consumer
spoiled
food
satanic
which
begs
question
satan
case
metaphorical
how
can
you
certain
allah
same
way
bottom
line
here
however
describing
spiritual
plane
human
language
something
like
describing
color
person
who
has
been
blind
from
birth
you
may
want

some
deleted
space
saving
when
language
fails
because
cannot
used
adequately
describe
another
dimension
which
cannot
experienced
speakers
conventions
metaphor
allegory
like
come
necessary
unseen
described
terms
which
have
reference
meaning
reader
listener
like
all
models
compro
mise
must
made
when
speaking
metaphorically
clarity
directness
meaning
equivalence
perception
like
all
crippled
what
else
can
you
do
why
i
asked
above
how
would
you
know
god
exists
spirit
being
rather
than
just
being
metaphorical
i
mean
okay
say
well
satan
just
metaphorical
you
have
justify
belief
justify
god
some
metaphor
something
else
i
say
because
many
many
instances
satan
described
being
tormentor
old
testament
book
job
temptor
new
testament
gospels
same
way
god
too
described
being
spirit
how
am
i
know
one
metaphorical
other
further
belief
god
isn
bar
evil
let
consider
case
satanists
even
satan
were
metaphorical
satanist
would
have
believe
god
justify
belief
again
we
have
case
where
someone
does
believe
god
religious
standards
evil
bobby
does
see
let
him
address
question
also
deleted
some
more
metaphor
obviously
more
philosophizing
issue
possible
i
m
sure
readers
newsgroup
would
want
delve
religious
interpretation
further
however
anyone
wishes
discuss
i
m
certainly
willing
