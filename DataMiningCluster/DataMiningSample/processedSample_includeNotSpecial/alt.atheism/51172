how

you
know
god
doesn
cause
each
every
natural
disaster
specific
purpose
mind
would
certainly
go
along
sadistic
nature
i
ve
seen
bible
even
satan
had
nothing
do
original
inception
disease
evolution
random
chance
would
have
produced
them
since
humanity
forsook
god
protection
we
choose
live
apart
from
god

collectively
should
come

come
after
them
perhaps
were
majority
i
you
weren
around
vote
perhaps
we
might
have
voted
differently
about
what

tree
your
god
never
asked
us
he
just
assumes
you
have
two
bad
people
