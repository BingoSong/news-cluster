first
i
want
start
right
out
say
i
m
christian
okay
what
all
rest
them
who
come
here
say
makes
sense
one
have
any
you
read
tony
campollo
book
liar
lunatic
real
thing
i
might
little
off
title
he
writes
book
anyway
he
part
effort
destroy
christianity
process
he
became
christian
himself
isn
guy
who
lawyer
he
could
you
give
more
info
guy
never
mind
i
m
sure
plenty
responses
post
appear
arguements
he
uses
i
am
summing
up
book
about
whether
jesus
god
i
know
many
you
don
believe
listen
different
perspective
we
all
have
something
gain
listening
what
others
have
say
true
make
sure
true
all
cases
book
says
jesus
either
liar
he
crazy
why
both
modern
day
koresh
he
actually
who
he
said
he
some
reasons
why
he
wouldn
liar
follows
who
would
die
lie
wouldn
people
able
tell
he
liar
why
die
lie
you
were
poverty
stricken
alunatic
sounds
perfecetly
reasoable
me
whether
societal
dregs
he
had
followers
would
able
tell
he
liar
necessarily
even
he
died
what
he
believed
still
makes
him
completely
selfish
like
us
all
so
what
difference
people
gathered
around
him
kept
doing
many
gathered
from
hearing
seeing
someone
who
had
been
healed
call
me
fool
i
believe
he
did
heal
people
historical
proof
see
earlier
threads
besides
he
least
his
name
have
been
cause
enough
deaths
make
up
whatever
healing
he
gave
niether
he
lunatic
would
more
than
entire
nation
drawn
someone
who
crazy
sieg
heil
very
doubtful
fact
rediculous
example
anyone
who
drawn
david
koresh
obviously
fool
logical
people
see
right
away
who
david
koresh
i
am
curious
therefore
since
he
wasn
liar
lunatic
he
must
have
been
real
thing
how
does
follow
your
definition
lunatic
disproof
thereof
seem
rather
uhhh
shaky
some
other
things
note
he
fulfilled
loads
prophecies
psalms
isaiah
elsewhere
hrs
alone
his
betrayal
crucifixion
i
don
have
my
bible
me
moment
next
time
i
write
i
use
good
idea
i
don
think
most
people
understand
what
christian
certainly
what
i
see
lot
churches
naturally
those
true
christians
right
rather
i
think
should
way
life
total
sacrafice
everything
god
sake
he
loved
us
enough
die
save
us
so
we
should
do
same
hey
we
can
do
god
himself
inspires
us
turn
our
lives
over
him
tuff
most
people
don
want
do
real
christian
would
something
strong
persevere
just
like
weight
lifting
guitar
playing
drums
whatever
takes
time
we
don
rush
one
day
christianity
your
whole
life
going
church
once
week
helping
poor
people
once
while
we
box
everything
time
units
work
time
sports
tv
social
life
god
above
boxes
should
carried
us
all
boxes
we
have
created
ourselves
someone
else
handle
i
don
know
worth
sigh
adam
john
cooper
verily
often
have
i
laughed
weaklings
who
thought
themselves
good
simply
because
acooper
macalstr
edu
had
claws
