knowing
how

i

non

see
how
far

face

how

fine

discussion
i
think
should
illuminating

let
me
make
first
suggestion
when
arabic
words
especially
technical

become
use
let
us
define
them
those
especially
atheists
whom
may

please
also
note
though

what
i

claim
rejected
you
since
personal

i
withdraw

i
conditionally
retain

infallibility
so
called
twelve

which
clear
conflict
qur
places
twelve
imams
category

example
higher
than
muhammad
qur
shows

clearly
fallible
well
appears
given
your
abstruse
theological
statment
regarding
natures
twelve
imams
placing
them
different
metaphysical
category
than
