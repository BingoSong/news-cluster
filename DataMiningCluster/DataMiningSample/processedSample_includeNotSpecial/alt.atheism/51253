i
argue
your
latter
statement
i
believe
gods
exist
does
rest
upon
faith
you
making
positive
statement
gods
exist
strong
atheism
rather
than
merely
saying
i
don
know
therefore
don
believe
them
don
believe
weak
atheism
once
again
believe
god
different
than
saying
i
believe
god
does
exist
i
still
maintain
position
even
after
reading
faqs
strong
atheism
requires
faith
way
usually
used
my
view
you
saying
here
driving
car
requires
faith
car
drives
me
conclusion
i
have
more
faith
than
i
have
premises
argument
used
first
let
me
say
following
we
might
have
language
problem
here
regards
faith
existence
i
christian
maintain
god
does
exist
exist
means
have
being
space
time
god
does
have
being
god
being
kierkegaard
once
said
god
does
exist
he
eternal
said
i
feel
rather
pointless
debate
so
called
existence
god
what
i
m
doing
here
i
believe
god
source
ground
being
when
you
say
god
does
exist
i
also
accept
statement
we
obviously
mean
two
different
things
however
what
follows
i
use
phrase
existence
god
usual
sense
sense
i
think
you
using
i
would
like
clarification
upon
what
you
mean
existence
god
word
game
term
god
used
different
way
usually
when
you
use
different
definition
your
thing
until
commonly
accepted
you
would
have
say
way
i
define
god
does
exist
existence
itself
so
i
say
does
exist
interestingly
those
who
say
existence
exists
one
indubitable
statements
possible
further
saying
god
existence
either
waste
time
existence
already
used
need
replace
god
you
implying
more
which
case
your
definition
your
argument
so
far
incomplete
making
fallacy
deletion
one
can
never
prove
god
does
does
exist
when
you
say
you
believe
god
does
exist
opinion
based
upon
observation
i
have
ask
what
observtions
you
refering
observations
pro
con
valid
here
establishing
positive
belief
deletion
where
does
follow
aren
observations
based
assumption
something
exists
wouldn
you
say
level
definition
assumption
god
meaningful
i
would
reject
concept
anyway
so
where
your
evidence
god
meaningful
some
level
