i
don
think
so
although
some
forms
execution
painful
electric
chair
looks
particularly
so
i
think
pain
relatively
short
lived
drawing
quartering
other
hand
looks
very
painful
victim
wouldn
die
right
away
he
d
bleed
death
i
d
imagine
ah
so
cruel
punishment
just
painful
you
origionally
stated
about
long
term
pain
eg
non
short
lived
why
sudden
chance
your
stance
i
don
think
i
ve
changed
my
stance
all
my
original
stance
painless
execution
cruel
one
i
didn
say
what
would
considered
cruel
only
painless
death
wasn
now
cruelty
must
involve
some
sort
suffering
i
believe
i
don
think
someone
gets
shot
head
electrocuted
really
suffers
very
much
even
hanging
probably
produces
one
sharp
instance
pain
over
so
quickly
hmmmmm
pardon
could
counter
example
has
been
made
which
renders
your
previous
stance
null
void
why
don
you
admit
your
previous
stance
incorrect
you
somehow
managed
slip
up
misstated
your
origional
stance
why
admit
well
again
i
stated
painless
death
isn
cruel
i
don
think
i
stated
all
painful
executions
cruel
i
think
some
cruel
depending
nature
duration
pain
way
how
long
too
long
anything
more
than
instant
i
guess
any
death
suffocation
asphyxiation
blood
loss
would
cruel
i
think
includes
gas
chamber
drawing
quartering
i
d
say
any
pain
lasts
say
over
twenty
seconds
so
would
too
long
may
arbitrary
cutoff
i
suppose
