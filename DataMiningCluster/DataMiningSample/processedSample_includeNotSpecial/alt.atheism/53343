supports
nothing
i
have
reason
believe
piece
anything
other
than
another
anti
islamic
slander
job
i
have
respect
titles
only
real
content
i
can
look
up
article
i
want
true
i
can
tell
you
bcci
islamic
bank
seeing
i
m
spending
my
time
responding
propaganda
responding
little
sub
thread
i
really
don
feel
deep
need
do
more
than
make
statements
effect
propaganda
false
someone
wants
discuss
issue
more
seriously
i
d
glad
have
real
discussion
providing
references
etc
you
must
admit
more
thorough
argument
supporting
proposition
than
your
propganda
because
i
say
so
i
hope
you
can
see
why
we
might
find
argument
compelling
you
want
refute
point
do
so
do
right
well
again
i
am
doing
much
poster
i
replying
too
i
am
quite
busy
really
don
have
time
respond
full
scholarly
form
every
accusation
flippantly
made
someone
who
being
clearly
antagonistic
have
you
ever
considered
perhaps
people
actually
believe
what
say
just
spreading
propaganda
i
have
considered
someone
spreads
falsehoods
out
ignorance
still
spreading
falsehoods
those
falsehoods
generally
do
come
out
nowhere
produced
people
who
know
what
saying
least
whole
truth
i
still
consider
spreading
falsehoods
propaganda
some
level
i
m
position
say
since
i
know
nothing
about
situation
does
my
estimation
qualify
me
having
my
head
up
my
ass
bob
i
never
accused
you
having
your
head
up
your
ass
takes
me
quite
some
time
dealing
someone
before
accusing
them
having
head
up
ass
i
accusing
original
poster
benedikt
i
believe
being
so
impaired
