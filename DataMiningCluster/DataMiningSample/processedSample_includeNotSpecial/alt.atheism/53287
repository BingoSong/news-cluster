am
i
making
wrong
assumption
basis
morals
where
do
come
from
question
came
from
idea
i
heard
morals
come
from
whatever
societally
mandated
only
one
aspect
morality
societal
morality
necessarily
very
crude
broad
brush
stuff
which
attempts
deal
what
necessary
keep
society
going
often
little
over
enthusiastic
about
doing
so
individual
morality
different
thing
often
includes
societal
mores
society
trouble
stronger
example
some
people
vegetarian
though
eating
meat
may
perfectly
legal
merely
question
basis
morality
moral
ethical
behavior
societally
acceptable
behavior
who
society
depends
society
doesn
help
point
irrelevant
often
answer
we
society
those
who
make
rules
different
question
society
who
should
make
rules
yet
another
i
don
claim
have
answers
either
i
don
think
we
do
very
well
ireland
i
like
some
things
about
us
system
least
principle
how
do
define
what
acceptable
depends
again
comes
from
certain
question
see
above
well
ideally
don
must
should
do
consensus
imo
how
do
we
keep
from
whatever
legal
what
moral
position
adopting
default
position
people
moral
decisions
none
society
business
so
how
can
we
put
people
jail
how
can
we
condemn
other
societies
because
sometimes
necessary
hard
trick
recognise
when
equally
importantly
when
isn
only
interfering
when
truly
necessary
why
would
necessary
what
right
do
we
have
interfere
imo
isn
often
interference
i
e
jail
force
various
kinds
degrees
both
necessary
effective
where
you
derive
right
interfere
difficult
question
sort
liar
paradox
force
necessary
freedom
one
possible
justification
people
who
wish
take
away
freedom
shouldn
object
own
freedom
taken
away
paradox
doesn
arise
we
don
actively
wish
take
way
anyone
freedom
introduction
permissible
interference
causes
problem
can
either
too
much
too
little
most
people
seem
agree
some
level
interference
necessary
see
need
justice
system
how
can
we
even
define
term
only
consensus
i
guess
thus
you
get
situation
where
law
often
allows
what
honour
forbids
which
i
ve
come
believe
should
i
admit
i
don
understand
statement
what
i
mean
while
thus
may
legal
thus
may
also
seen
immoral
law
lets
you
do
you
don
let
yourself
do
