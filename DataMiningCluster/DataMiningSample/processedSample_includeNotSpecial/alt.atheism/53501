probably
either

do
let
me
know
which
brilliant
example
using
introspective
objection
against
materialist
theories
consciousness
diplomatic
i
realize
i
m
fighting
occam
razor
argument
so
i
ll
try
explain
why
i
feel
mind
necessary
firstly
i
m
impressed
ability
algorithms
re
great
solving
problems
once
method
has
been
worked
out
working
out
method
itself
specific
example
i
like
solve
numerical
crosswords
simple
do
sums
insert
answers
type
hard
ones
do
any
efficiency
you
need
figure
out
variety
tricks
now
i
know
you
can
program
computer
do
puzzles
doing
so
you
have
work
out
tricks
yourself
program
them
computer
you
can
course
obfuscate
trick
write
program
so
uncovered
far
i
can
see
trick
still
has
some
form
discovered
does
mean
all
ideas
we
ever
have
already
pre
programmed
our
brains
somewhat
unlikely
given
our
brains
ultimately
encoded
chromosomes
worth
genetic
material
much
which
isn
used
one
way
around
bring
environment
equation
again
far
i
can
see
still
has
air
you
see

x
perform

y
we
don
seem
get
anywhere
algorithm
has
anticipate
what
might
see
what
conclusions
draw
from
experience
other
problem
algorithms
instability
many
algorithms
survive
you
take
out
large
portion
code
yet
people
survive
strokes
without
going
completely
haywire
side
effects
patients
still
seem
remarkably
stable
also
neurons
perfectly
healthy
people
dying
alarming
rate
can
algorithm
survive
i
randomly
corrupt
various
bits
code
next
problem
sticky
question
what
colour
replace
colour
sensation
your
choice
presumably
materialist
viewpoint
product
some
kind
chemical
reaction
usual
products
reaction
energy
different
chemicals
colour
mixture
so
computer
won
see
colour
because
chemistry
different
does
algorithm
sees
colour
have
selective
advantage
over
equivalent
doesn
shouldn
because
outputs
each
algorithm
ought
same
equivalent
circumstances
so
why
do
we
see
colour
however
view
actually
nonsolution
how
should
minds
able
act
observers
feel
pain
pleasure
issue
commands
any
better
than
brain
moreover
how
do
interactions
occur
bit
idle
speculation
i
remember
correctly
quantum
mechanics
consists
wavefunction
two
processes
acting
first
process
has
been
called
unitary
evolution
u
governed
schroedinger
equation
well
known
second
process
called
various
things
collapse
wavefunction
state
vector
reduction
r
more
mysterious
usually
said
occur
when
measurement
takes
place
although
nobody
seems
know
precisely
when
occurs
when
does
occur
effect
r
abruptly
change
wavefunction
i
envisage
r
interaction
between
wavefunction
something
else
which
i
shall
imaginitively
call
part
x
seems
reasonable
assume
something
causes
r
although
something
might
wavefunction
itself
which
case
part
x
simply
wavefunction
note
though
we
d
need
more
than
u
explain
r
anyway
i
m
speculating
minds
would
part
x
seems
some
link
between
consciousness
r
we
never
see
linear
superpositions
anything
although
alternative
explainations
i
ve
idea
how
brain
supposed
access
part
x
since
only
speculation
won
matter
too
much
my
main
point
might
place
minds
physics
i
ll
go
back
