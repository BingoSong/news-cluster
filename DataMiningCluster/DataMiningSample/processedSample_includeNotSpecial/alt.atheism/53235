thread
you
re
telling
us
natural
morality
what
animals
do
survive
thread
you
claiming
omniscient
being
can
definitely
say
what
right
what
wrong
so
what
does
omniscient
being
use
criterion
long
term
survival
human
species
what
well
question
isn
goals
probably
all
obvious
we
can
set
up
few
goals
like
happiness
liberty
golden
rule
etc
goals
aren
inherent
have
defined
before
objective
system
possible
how
does
omniscient
map
definitely
being
able
assign
right
wrong
actions
too
difficult
one
you
have
goals
mind
absolute
knoweldge
everyone
intent
etc
now
you
letting
omniscient
being
give
information
me
part
original
premise
well
your
original
premises
have
habit
changing
over
time
so
perhaps
you
d
like
review
us
tell
us
what
difference
between
omniscient
being
able
assign
right
wrong
actions
telling
us
result
omniscience
fine
long
information
given
away
isn
resolution
free
problem
interactive
omniscient
being
changes
situation
which
type
morality
you
talking
about
natural
sense
all
immoral
harm
another
species
long
doesn
adversely
affect
your
own
i
guess
i
m
talking
about
morality
introduced
you
which
going
implemented
omniscient
being
can
definitely
assign
right
wrong
actions
you
tell
us
what
type
morality
well
i
speaking
about
objective
system
general
i
didn
mention
specific
goal
which
would
necessary
determine
morality
action
