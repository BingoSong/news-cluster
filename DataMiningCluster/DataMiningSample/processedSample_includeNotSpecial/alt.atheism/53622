deletion
theism
correlated
fanaticism
i
have
neither
said
all
fanatism
caused
theism
nor
all
theism
leads
fanatism
point
theism
increases
chance
becoming
fanatic
one
could
course
argue
would
fanatics
tend
towards
theism
example
i
just
have
loook
times
history
when
theism
dominant
ideology
invalidate
conclusion
basic
mechanism
behind
imo
influence
stalin
matter
ayn
rand
invalidates
your
assumption
theism
factor
considered
bogus
i
just
said
theism
only
factor
fanatism
point
theism
factor
your
claim
now
back
up
i
consider
your
argument
useful
following
belief
strongly
correlated
fanaticism
therefore
belief
factor
fanaticism
true
utterly
useless
note
any
belief
belief
gods
tiring
say
least
i
have
backed
up
read
first
statement
i
have
read
conspicuous
its
absence
any
evidence
point
latter
fallacy
wrong
analogy
saying
someone
believes
something
hardly
information
about
person
all
saying
someone
theist
holds
much
more
information
further
correlation
between
theists
fanatism
higher
than
between
belief
all
fanatism
because
special
features
theistic
belief
truth
blatant
assertion
evidence
gullibility
blind
obedience
authority
lack
scepticism
so
all
more
reliable
indicators
really
dangerous
people
sources
fanaticism
often
none
things
cynical
manipulators
gullible
who
know
precisely
what
doing
claim
you
have
support
please
note
especially
field
theism
leaders
believe
what
say
you
believe
you
re
incredibly
naive
you
frank
o
dwyer
living
dream
world
i
wonder
any
base
discussion
left
after
statement
matter
fact
i
think
you
ignorant
human
nature
even
when
one
starts
something
one
does
believe
one
gets
easily
fooled
actually
believing
what
one
says
give
you
benefit
doubt
prove
your
statement
onus
proof
you
sunshine
what
makes
you
think
theist
leaders
believe
what
say
especially
when
say
one
thing
do
another
say
one
thing
closely
followed
its
opposite
practice
restricted
theism
anyone
see
almost
epidemic
country
just
instance
harder
camel
pass
thru
eye
needle
why
catholic
church
wealthy
land
owner
why
churches
square
inch
my
country
now
some
brands
theism
more
precisely
some
theists
do
tend
fanaticism
i
grant
you
tar
all
theists
brush
bigotry
reasoned
argument
reads
me
like
warm
up
censorship
restriction
religious
freedom
ever
read
animal
farm
straw
man
usually
discussions
you
one
has
repeat
read
what
i
have
written
above
every
theism
leads
fanatism
all
fanatism
caused
theism
point
correlation
comes
from
innate
features
theism
some
comes
from
features
which
some
theism
has
common
some
fanaticism
your
last
statement
simply
isn
implied
what
you
say
before
because
you
re
trying
sneak
innate
features
all
theism
word
you
re
groping
some
bogus
again
all
theism
fanatic
however
rest
already
gives
backup
statement
about
correlation
about
fanatism
theism
further
specialty
other
theistic
beliefs
allows
them
switch
fanatism
easily
takes
just
nifty
improvement
theology
truth
blatant
assertion
gullibility
way
one
them
shit
sherlock
so
why
talk
about
gullibility
instead
theism
since
seems
whole
lot
more
relevant
case
you
have
opposed
case
you
trying
make
because
more
about
theism
attraction
gullible
people
causing
correlation
whole
discussion
started
way
statement
theism
meaningfully
correlated
fanatism
which
you
challenged
indeed
i
did
i
recall
i
asked
evidence
what
correlation
which
you
speak
say
i
am
going
forbid
religion
another
your
straw
men
interesting
you
have
nothing
better
offer
i
said
reads
like
warm
up
because
irrational
bogus
tirade
has
other
use
than
creating
nice
them
us
split
minds
excitable
people
found
either
side
church
walls
blah
blah
blah
i
am
quite
well
aware
giving
everyone
rights
protects
me
better
from
fanatics
than
other
way
round
course
other
people
always
fanatics
never
oneself
your
wish
slur
all
theists
seems
pretty
fanatical
me
quite
nice
see
you
actually
implying
connection
between
argument
rise
fanatism
so
far
just
another
your
assertions
so
you
can
do
define
irrational
belief
e
g
rational
believe
reason
always
useful
irrational
belief
belief
based
upon
reason
latter
has
been
discussed
long
time
charley
wingate
one
point
beliefs
violate
reason
often
another
process
does
lend
itself
rational
analysis
does
contain
reliable
information
well
glaring
paradox
here
argument

circular
argument

irrational
which
bogus
self

circular
since
evaluation

allowed
o

still
begging
question
however
though
certainly
allowed
rational
you
claiming
rational
all
another
your
assertions
proof
evidence
just
claims
hey
i
learned
from
you
did
i
do
good
risk
repeating
myself
hearing
we
had
before
we
didn
hear
refutation
before
so
we
re
back
deal
you
can
use
reason
demonstrate
reason
useful
someone
who
thinks
reason
crap
won
buy
you
see
unusually
weak
even
you
latter
implies
my
proof
depends
opinion
somehow
who
does
accept
triangles
won
accept
pythagoras
wow
incredible
insight
i
don
have
prove
them
wrong
opinion
possible
show
systems
leave
out
useful
information
respectively
claims
unreliable
even
absurd
statements
information
totally
circular
totally
useless
wish

believe

judges
appeal
information
makes
you
feel
good
when
you
believe
may
good
them
contains
zillions
possible
pitfalls
from

despite
contrary
evidence
bogus
proofs
attempt
truth
blatant
assertion
i
ve
seen
many
bogus
proofs
non
existence
gods
i
have
existence
rational
systems
way
does
mean
every
data
has
come
from
logical
analysis
point
evaluation
data
does
contradict
logic
easily
follows
system
does
allows
evaluate
its
rational
itself
yes
possible
evaluate
rational
system
rational
fallacies
system
since
validity
axioms
agreed
upon
has
little
impact
possibility
demon
ala
descartes
just
doesn
parse
sorry
so
far
just
matter
consistency
i
use
ratiional
arguments
show
my
system
consistent
theirs
isn
evaluation
nor
predictions
does
need
rationality
does
contradict
however
your
argument
silly
proving
mathematical
statements
needs
mathematics
mathematics
therfore
circular
anybody
else
think
godel
silly
stream
consciousness
typing
what
supposed
mean
first
part
second
statement
contains
information
because
you
don
say
what
beliefs
beliefs
strong
theism
strong
atheism
your
statement
general
true
second
part
your
sentence
patently
false
counterexample
axiomatic
datum
does
lend
itself
rational
analysis
assumed
contain
reliable
information
regardless
what
process
used
obtain
i
ve
been
speaking
religious
systems
contradictory
definitions
god
here
axiomatic
datum
lends
itself
rational
analysis
what
you
say
here
often
refuted
fallacy
have
look
discussion
axiom
choice
further
one
can
evaluate
axioms
larger
systems
out
which
usually
derived
i
exist
derived
you
want
way
further
one
can
test
consistency
so
set
axioms
what
you
trying
say
some
point
people
always
wind
up
saying
datum
reliable
particular
reason
all
example
i
am
dreaming
nope
evidence
trick
choice
axiomatic
basis
system
difficult
because
possibilities
interwoven
one
therefore
chooses
least
assumptions
assumptions
necessary
get
information
out
system
anyway
i
d
like
see
alleged
evidence
one
does
need
define
axioms
order
define
evaluation
method
usefulness
foundation
laid
how
one
feels
all
how
one
feels
about
i
see
you
have
irrational
beliefs
fanatics
never
do
do
compared
evidence
theists
have
claims
strength
demands
makes
whole
thing
only
irrational
antirational
i
can
agree
until
you
specific
which
theism
say
all
theism
necessarily
antirational
requires
proof
which
i
suspect
you
do
have
using
traditonal
definition
gods
personal
supernatural
entities
objective
effects
world
usually
connected
morals
way
world
works
imo
any
belief
about
gods
necessarily
irrational
does
mean
people
who
hold
them
principle
opposed
exercise
intelligence
some
atheists
also
scientists
example
don
use
theism
when
doing
science
wouldn
science
please
note
subjective
data
lend
themselves
scientific
treatment
well
just
prohibit
formulating
them
objective
statements
ergo
nothing
objective
fair
enough
affinity
fanatism
easily
seen
has
true
because
i
believe
nothing
more
than
work
hypothesis
however
beliefs
say
more
than
work
hypothesis
i
don
understand
can
you
formalise
your
argument
person
believes
system
b
becuase
sounds
so
nice
does
make
b
true
best
work
hypothesis
however
content
b
true
more
than
work
hypothesis
testing
evaluating
evidence
against
therefore
dismissed
because
b
already
believed
says
wrong
waste
time
possible
depending
further
contents
b
amalekites
idolaters
protestants
killed
can
have
interesting
effects
peculiar
definition
interesting
sure
now
show
belief
gods
entails
further
contents
which
you
speak
why
aren
my
catholic
neighbours
out
killing
protestants
example
maybe
don
believe
maybe
conjunction
b
asserts
b
jail
kill
dissenters
important
belief
gods
entirely
irrelevant
certainly
seems
so
me
i
have
axe
grind
here
example
your
neighbours
fallacy
your
neighbours
don
says
little
about
others
were
times
when
exactly
happened
nope
fallacy
just
doesn
go
correlation
you
wish
see
tell
me
when
irrelevant
why
statements
about
amalekites
idolaters
holy
books
please
note
one
could
edit
them
out
when
relevant
anymore
because
gods
don
err
what
does
say
about
message
excuse
me
holy
books
how
come
we
had
theists
saying
genocides
ordered
god
ok
god
easiest
way
excuse
anything
therefore
highly
attracting
fanatics
mention
effect
interpretation
fanatics
can
have
rest
believers
happens
again
again
again
god
neither
easiest
way
excuse
anything
nor
only
way
