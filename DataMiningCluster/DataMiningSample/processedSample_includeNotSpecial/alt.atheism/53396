merely
question
basis
morality
moral
ethical
behavior
societally
acceptable
behavior
i
disagree
what
society
thinks
should
irrelevant
what
individual
decides
all
important
doesn
seem
right
i
want
kill
you
i
can
because
what
i
decide
exactly
although
may
dissapointing
answer
has
interplay
two
personal
ethos
societal
morality
person
self
generated
learned
set
beliefs
usually
expressed
purely
mental
verbal
level
don
usually
find
expression
society
except
impure
sense
bad
state
sometimes
has
so
who
society
i
think
fairly
obvious
really
whatever
particular
society
mandates
ok
ok
always
some
society
who
disagree
mandates
so
which
societal
mandates
make
standard
morality
also
what
one
feels
oneself
part
more
than
one
society
very
real
sense
use
obvious
example
political
society
racial
society
gender
society
sometimes
do
always
agree
every
issue
how
do
define
what
acceptable
generally
what
feel
right
which
most
idiotic
policy
i
can
think
so
what
should
basis
unfortunately
i
have
admit
being
tied
least
loosely
feeling
i
think
we
intuitively
know
some
things
wrong
awfully
hard
defend
though
yes
perhaps
infamous
do
what
you
want
so
long
doesn
hurt
others
problem
merely
saying
what
you
can
do
morality
doesn
propound
any
specifically
preferred
behaviours
how
do
we
keep
from
whatever
legal
what
moral
position
thinking
ourselves
i
might
agree
here
just
because
certain
actions
legal
does
make
them
moral
i
ll
add
hearty
me
two
however
one
could
just
well
say
just
because
certain
actions
moral
does
make
them
legal
one
still
doesn
really
get
impression
which
one
truly
right
