dan
lawrence
bissell
writes
book
says
jesus
either
liar
he
crazy
modern
day
koresh
he
actually
who
he
said
he
he
just
convinced
religious
fantasies
time
he
messiah
he
just
some
rebel
leader
organisation
jews
built
godhood
purpose
off
throwing
yoke
roman
oppression
some
reasons
why
he
wouldn
liar
follows
who
would
die
lie
moslem
fanatics
who
strap
bombs
backs
driving
jewish
embassies
dying
truth
hint
think
were
nazi
soldiers
wwii
dying
truth
people
die
lies
all
time
wouldn
people
able
tell
he
liar
people
hitler
liar
how
about
napoleon
mussolini
ronald
reagan
we
spend
millions
dollars
year
trying
find
techniques
detect
lying
so
answer
wouldn
able
tell
he
liar
he
only
lied
about
some
things
gathered
around
him
kept
doing
many
gathered
from
hearing
seeing
someone
who
had
been
healed
call
me
fool
i
believe
he
did
heal
people
why
do
you
think
he
healed
people
because
bible
says
so
god
doesn
exist
other
possibility
bible
divinely
inspired
one
can
use
piece
evidence
written
unbiased
observers
niether
he
lunatic
would
more
than
entire
nation
drawn
someone
who
crazy
very
doubtful
fact
rediculous
example
were
hitler
mussolini
lunatics
how
about
genghis
khan
jim
jones
thousands
examples
through
history
people
being
drawn
lunatics
anyone
who
drawn
david
koresh
obviously
fool
logical
people
see
right
away
therefore
since
he
wasn
liar
lunatic
he
must
have
been
real
thing
so
we
obviously
cannot
rule
out
liar
lunatic
mention
all
other
possibilities
given
triad
some
other
things
note
he
fulfilled
loads
prophecies
psalms
isaiah
elsewhere
hrs
alone
his
betrayal
possibly
self
fulfilling
prophecy
ie
he
aware
what
he
should
do
order
fulfil
prophecies
possibly
selective
diting
behalf
those
keepers
holy
bible
thousand
years
so
before
general
public
had
access
possibly
also
text
written
riddles
like
nostradamus
anything
happens
can
twisted
fit
words
raving
fictional
prophecy
crucifixion
i
don
have
my
bible
me
moment
next
time
i
write
i
use
stuff
about
how
hard
christian
deleted
i
severely
recommend
you
reconsider
reasons
you
christian
very
unconvincing
unbiased
observer
