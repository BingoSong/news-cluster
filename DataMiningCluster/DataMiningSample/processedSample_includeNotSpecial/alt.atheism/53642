noting
particular

case
mainland

has
few
religously
motivated
murders
few
murders
any

says
very
little
about
whether
inter

religiously

catholicism

christian
bible

i

majority
people
have
moral
system
instructs
them
kill
under

theism
rather
depends
what
certain
circumstances
when
you
talk
about
christianity
islam
least
your
claims
can
understood
when
people
go
general
statement
about
theism
falls
apart
one
could
believe
god
which
instructs
one
utterly
harmless
my
part
i
conclude
something
else
required
i
also
happen
believe
something
else
work
less
well
without

any
easy
them
us
do
what
does
religion
supply
easy
them
us
necessarily
love
thy
neighbour
does
supply
them
us
demolishes
my
definition
religion
broader
than
my
definition
theism
i
have
explained
insisting
even
murder
four
labourers
chosen
because
were
catholics
who
had
nothing
do
ira
protestant
extremists
religously
motivated
i
think
what
you
saying
you
simply
accept
any
murder
being
religiously
motivated
what
about
guy
who
cut
off
someone
head
because
he
believed
he
devil
incarnate
religously
motivated
what
about
protestant
extremists
who
killed
four
catholic
labourers
wasn
religiously
motivated
my
opinion
were
doing
because
some
obscure
point
theology
yes
since
all
protestants
don
do
nor
do
elect
extremists
do
them
just
too
broad
too
say
religion
did
i
m
saying
causes
far
more
complex
than
take
away
religious
element
you
d
still
have
powerful
motives
revenge
misguided
patriotism
you
know
when
most
catholics
protestants
worldwide
say
stop
killing
one
might
listen
especially
when
you
claim
read
minds
also
murders
ensuing
from
fatwa
mr
rushdie
inquisitions
many
religous
wars
what
so
special
about
exceptions
isn
all
just
grab
bag
ad
hoc
excuses
considering
some
other
murders
religiously
motivated
what
general
principle
behind
all
general
principle
fairly
clear
me
least
religion
primary
motivator
enabler
whatever
nearly
so
obvious
what
going
when
one
looks
ni
apart
from
violence
course
abstract
argument
northern
irish
protestants
say
we
don
want
absorbed
am
officially
catholic
country
now
what
we
supposed
do
we
supposed
reply
only
what
you
think
you
don
want
mr
o
dwyer
assures
us
matter
what
you
say
you
want
you
really
want
something
else
you
think
unionists
wouldn
mind
being
absorbed
non
catholic
country
other
than
uk
course
terrible
thing
lose
mind
maybe
word
country
more
than
just
kicks
i
certainly
don
believe
unionists
god
i
think
wish
maintain
position
privilege
i
m
still
listening
what
say
you
still
telling
us
your
version
what
think
you
read
minds
i
don
you
ve
speculated
my
motives
often
enough
you
don
take
my
statements
my
own
beliefs
face
value
therefore
your
claim
read
minds
has
credibility
me
sorry
i
also
note
you
fail
answer
my
question
just
looks
me
very
much
like
you
have
axe
grind
especially
you
indeed
ignoring
what
most
protestants
say
which
stop
killing
people
you
refer
properly
described
unionists
protestants
position
privilege
what
religion
based
based
politics
bigotry
heartless
extremism
none
things
synonymous
religion
though
certainly
some
overlap
