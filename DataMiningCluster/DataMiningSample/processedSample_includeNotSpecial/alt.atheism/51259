i
have
clearly

terrifies
gay

our
lifestyle
words

i
sent
roger
very
calm
carefully
written
detailed
letter
explaining
simply
why
bsa
policy
does
indeed
terrify
me
i
did
use
inflammatory

left
myself
extremely
open

i
have
received

i
can
conclude
only
roger
considers
his

either
indefensible
simply
worth
defending
trying
cloud

minorities
also
meaningless

control
race
can
control
behavior
fact
exactly
point
people
can
control
behavior
because
fact
need
blanket
ban
homosexuals
what
else
possibly
discuss
