i
love
god
just
much
she
loves
me
she
wants
seduce
me
she
ll
know
what
do
he
she
did
you
would
probably
consider
rape
course
i
would
think
would
great
fun
having
ever
felt
joy
peace
christians
speak
longing
gaze
what
i
got
when
i
believed
i
just
tried
hide
my
fear
getting
punished
something
i
never
sure
bible
hopelessly
confusing
someone
who
wants
know
sure
god
did
answer
end
i
found
i
had
been
following
mass
delusion
lie
i
can
believe
being
who
refuses
give
slightest
hint
her
existence
obviously
many
christians
who
have
tried
do
believe
so
i
suggest
should
honestly
reconsider
reasons
why
believe
analyse
position
fact
amusing
note
context
many
fundamentalist
publications
tell
us
exactly
opposite
one
should
examine
one
belief
critically
i
ll
tell
you
something
i
left
out
my
testimony
i
posted
group
two
months
ago
day
after
i
finally
found
out
my
faith
over
i
decided
try
just
one
more
time
same
cycle
emotional
responses
fired
once
again
time
delusion
lasted
only
couple
hours
i
told
my
friend
phone
really
works
thank
god
just
think
about
again
when
i
hung
up
i
had
admit
i
had
lied
fallen
prey
same
illusion
one
asks
you
swallow
everything
fact
jesus
warns
against
let
me
ask
you
question
do
you
beleive
what
you
learn
history
class
matter
anything
school
i
mean
just
what
other
people
have
told
you
you
don
want
swallow
what
others
say
right
i
used
believe
what
i
read
books
when
i
younger
what
other
people
told
me
i
grew
more
more
skeptical
more
i
read
i
learned
what
means
use
reason
student
chemistry
i
had
perform
qualitative
analysis
mixture
two
organic
compounds
lab
i
hated
experiments
like
old
fashioned
increase
student
workload
considerably
besides
i
had
do
twice
since
i
failed
my
first
attempt
however
i
think
i
ll
never
forget
lesson
matter
how
strongly
you
believe
structure
unknown
x
may
still
y
very
tempting
jump
conclusions
take
leap
faith
assure
oneself
ignore
data
which
inconsistent
can
still
wrong
i
found
out
i
after
all
using
exactly
same
mechanism
believe
god
mental
self
assurance
suspension
fear
filtering
information
other
words
only
me
god
playing
any
part
life
death
resurection
christ
documented
historical
fact
oh
i
had
better
believe
dan
many
ufo
stories
much
better
documented
than
resurrection
jesus
resurrection
documented
quite
haphazardly
bible
seems
authors
did
pay
too
much
attention
which
wild
rumour
leave
out
besides
ends
gospels
probably
contain
later
additions
insertions
instance
end
mark
missing
from
many
early
texts
says
my
bible
jesus
may
have
lived
died
he
probably
misunderstood
much
anything
else
you
learn
how
do
you
choose
what
believe
what
easy
i
believe
world
exists
independent
my
mind
logic
reason
can
used
interpret
analyse
what
i
observe
nothing
else
need
taken
faith
i
go
evidence
makes
difference
whether
i
believe
george
washington
existed
i
assume
he
did
considering
vast
amount
evidence
presented
way
get
sceptical
heart
you
can
say
you
have
given
sincere
effort
attitude
you
seem
have
you
must
trust
just
go
church
participate
activities
were
you
ever
willing
die
what
you
believed
liar
how
do
you
know
what
my
attitude
try
reading
your
bible
again
i
willing
die
my
faith
those
who
do
usually
remembered
heroes
least
among
those
who
believe
dan
do
you
think
i
m
lying
when
i
say
i
believed
firmly
years
seems
very
difficult
admit
someone
who
has
really
believed
does
do
so
anymore
i
can
go
lying
myself
blind
trust
dangerous
i
just
another
blind
led
blind
god
really
wants
me
she
ll
know
what
do
i
m
willing
i
just
don
know
whether
she
exists
looking
available
evidence
looks
like
