indeed
reverse
naturalist
probably
scientist
would
say

something
new
perhaps
we
didn

i
contend
proper
implementation
christian
faith
requires
reasoning

glad

how
jim

when
southern
baptist

do
you
have
reason
blame
mainstream
religion
behaviors
people
should
i
associate
every
negative
behavior
i
witness
any
non
christian
you
you
seem
have
missed
my
point
even
jim
jones
david
koresh
were
religious
people
my
point
remains
faith
dogma
dangerous
religion
encourages
them
jim
jones
david
koresh
also
encouraged
them
my
point
does
rely
jim
jones
david
koresh
being
religious
