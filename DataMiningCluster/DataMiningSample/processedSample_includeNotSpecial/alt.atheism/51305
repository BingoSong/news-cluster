i
think
objective
morality
does
exist
most
flavors
morality
only
approximations
once
again
natural
objective
morality
fairly
easily
defined
long
you
have
goal
mind
what
purpose
morality
maybe
i
m
quite
getting
what
you
mean
i
think
objective
morality
oxymoron
definition
seems
any
goal
oriented
issue
like
subjective
nature
i
don
get
how
you
re
using
word
objective
goal
need
subjective
one
instance
goal
natural
morality
propogation
species
perhaps
wasn
really
until
more
intelligent
animals
came
along
some
revisions
were
necessary
intelligent
animals
have
different
needs
than
others
hence
morality
suited
them
must
bit
more
complicated
than
law
jungle
i
don
think
self
actualization
so
subjective
you
might
think
objectivity
i
am
assuming
ideals
any
system
could
carried
out
completely
