writes
anyway
since
i
seem
only
one
following
particular
line
discussion
i
wonder
how
many
rest
readership
have
read
book
what
your
thoughts
i
read
when
first
came
out
controversy
broke
put
my
name
waiting
list
library
way
book
really
offensive
none
my
money
would
find
its
way
author
publisher
read
cover
cover
use
phrase
seems
popular
here
right
now
i
liked
writing
style
little
hard
get
used
well
worth
effort
coming
from
similar
background
rushdie
grew
up
bombay
muslim
family
moved
england
i
grew
up
new
delhi
made
strong
impression
me
he
used
many
strange
constructions
indian
english
yaar
end
sentence
butbutbut
occasional
hindi
phrase
etc
time
i
still
sorta
kinda
thought
myself
muslim
i
couldn
see
what
flap
all
about
seemed
clear
me
allegory
clear
he
described
some
local
prostitutes
who
took
names
personae
muhammed
wives
had
my
grandfather
thundered
implied
muhammed
wives
were
prostitutes
short
every
angry
muslim
had
read
even
part
book
seemed
have
missed
point
completely
i
won
mention
fact
most
militant
them
had
never
even
seen
book
oops
i
just
did
perhaps
deep
sense
book
insulting
islam
because
exposes
silliness
revealed
religion
why
does
omnipotent
deity
need
agent
she
can
come
directly
me
can
she
how
do
we
know
muhammed
didn
just
go
out
desert
smoke
something
how
do
we
know
scribes
he
dictated
quran
didn
screw
up
put
own
little
verses
why
can
muhammed
marry
more
than
four
women
when
other
muslim
allowed
although
i
think
biggest
insult
islam
majority
its
followers
would
want
suppress
book
sight
unseen
say
so
some
holy
guy
mention
murder
author
over
years
when
i
have
made
point
various
primarily
muslim
posters
have
responded
saying
yes
indeed
have
read
book
had
called
things
filth
lies
i
would
rank
rushdie
book
hitler
mein
kempf
worse
so
i
had
much
same
response
when
i
tried
talk
about
book
really
silly
argument
after
all
how
many
same
people
have
read
mein
kampf
just
made
me
wonder
what
afraid
why
don
just
read
book
decide
themselves
maybe
reaction
muslim
community
book
absence
protest
from
liberal
muslims
khomeini
fatwa
outrage
final
push
i
needed
atheism
