well
john
has
quite
different
necessarily
more
elaborated
theology
some
evidence
he
must
have
known
luke
content
q
known
him
canonized
form
new
argument
me
could
you
elaborate
little
argument
goes
follows
q
oid
quotes
appear
john
almost
codified
way
were
matthew
luke
however
considered
similar
enough
point
knowledge
q
entirely
different
source
assuming
he
knew
luke
would
obviously
put
him
after
luke
would
give
evidence
latter
assumption
i
don
think
follows
you
take
most
traditional
attributions
luke
might
have
known
john
john
elder
figure
either
case
we
re
talking
spans
time
here
which
well
within
range
lifetimes
we
talking
date
texts
here
age
authors
usual
explanation
time
order
mark
matthew
luke
does
consider
respective
ages
says
matthew
has
read
text
mark
luke
matthew
probably
mark
assumed
john
knew
content
luke
text
evidence
overwhelming
admittedly
earlier
manuscripts
john
have
been
discovered
interesting
where
which
how
dated
how
old
unfortunately
i
haven
got
info
hand
i
think
late
early
possibly
old
ce
when
from
about
why
do
shed
doubt
order
putting
john
after
rest
three
i
don
see
your
point
exactly
what
james
felder
said
had
first
hand
knowledge
events
obvious
least
two
them
used
older
texts
base
account
even
association
luke
paul
mark
peter
generally
accepted
well
genuine
letter
peter
would
close
enough
wouldn
sure
original
together
id
card
sender
receiver
would
fine
so
what
supposed
say
am
i
missing
something
i
don
think
one
step
removed
source
bad
luke
mark
matthew
learned
stories
directly
from
diciples
i
really
cannot
believe
sort
big
transformation
from
jesus
gospel
some
people
posit
news
reports
one
generally
gets
better
information
than
john
diciple
nothing
more
said
john
disciple
generally
accepted
style
language
together
theology
usually
used
counterargument
argument
john
disciple
relies
claim
gospel
john
itself
any
other
evidence
one
step
one
generation
removed
bad
even
our
times
compare
reports
similar
events
our
century
almost
illiterate
societies
even
speak
off
believers
necessarily
best
sources
also
obvious
mark
has
been
edited
how
old
oldest
manuscripts
my
knowledge
which
can
antiquated
oldest
quite
after
any
estimates
even
complete
only
clear
editing
problem
ending
basically
hopeless
mess
oldest
versions
give
strong
sense
incompleteness
point
where
shortest
versions
seem
break
off
midsentence
most
obvious
solution
some
point
part
text
lost
material
from
verse
pretty
clearly
later
seems
represent
synopsys
end
luke
other
words
one
does
know
what
original
mark
did
look
like
arguments
based
mark
pretty
weak
how
connected
redating
