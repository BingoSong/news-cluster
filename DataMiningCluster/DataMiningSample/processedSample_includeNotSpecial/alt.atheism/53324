i
suspect
you

jewish

you
have
been

one
problem
highly

like
what

some

relative

success
society
e
g
obviously
true
comparing
practices
surrounding
people
instance
according
bible
surrounding
people
were
immoral
savages
repulsive
inhuman
habits
we
need
look
rather
what
those
peoples
were
really
like
instance
what
way
better
worship
single
god
whose
presence
symbolically
strongest
tent
temple
over
multiple
gods
some
whose
presence
symbolically
represented
statue
bible
own
terms
idolatry
inherently
evil
i
see
evidence
followers
various
other

area

were
particularly
bad
people
relative
people

now
past
our
ancestors
did
cut

least
knew
inhumane

cut
bare
teeth
so
relatively
enlightened
step
forward
from
earlier
barbarism
made

modern

paper
cutting
much
easier
sounds
good
presupposes
teeth
rending
neighbors
which
i
see
support
one
can
argue
post

assertion
inhumane
neighbors
can
used
make
moral
points
doesn
mean
actual
neighbors
really
were
inhuman
more
point
dehumanization
people

even
different
people
dwelling

us
all
too
common
complex
benign
moral
traditions
have
evolved
based

mythic
interpretations
history
interesting
i
still
don
think
fair
take
long
tradition
interpretation
use
attack
condemnation
original

note
i
m
speaking
historical
interpretation
here
instance
claiming
hammurabi
eye
eye
primitive
brutal
retribution
while
moses
version
enlightened
benign
fine
because
tradition
has
since
interpreted
phrase
way
years
ago
so
probably
both
meant
same
thing
sure
i
m
arguing
from
parochial

i
belong

has

i
don
belittle

particularly
intellectual
ones
jewish
people
i
have
given
up
trying

analogy
since
i
don
know
any
other

all
similar
closest
i
can
think
romany
i
don
know
enough
about
them
make
meaningful

i
think
tradition
reflective
study
flexible
rather
than
dogmatic
