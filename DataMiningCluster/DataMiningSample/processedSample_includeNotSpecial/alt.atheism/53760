mil
his
conclusion
while
he
impressed
what
little
holy
qur
had
say
about
science
accurate
he
far
more
impressed
holy
qur
did
contain
same
rampant
errors
evidenced
traditions
how
would
man
th
century
arabia
have
known
what
include
holy
qur
assuming
he
had
authored
well
looks
like
folks
soc
religion
islam
have
loosened
up
bit
discussing
topic
well
banking
interest
topic
few
books
subject
have
also
been
mentioned
addition
one
you
mentioned
may
hard
find
i
think
i
may
take
stab
out
curiosity
i
know
one
film
i
saw
subject
pretty
weak
only
two
quotes
i
have
seen
which
were
used
show
science
koran
which
i
posted
here
were
also
pretty
vague
i
suspect
books
extrapolate
awful
lot
quotes
have
least
one
poster
islam
channel
seems
have
some
misgivings
about
practice
using
koran
decide
what
good
science
i
wonder
islam
has
ever
come
up
equivalent
christians
creation
science
any
topic
would
interesting
find
history
scientific
interpretations
koran
see
anyone
used
koran
support
earlier
science
which
has
since
been
discarded
all
too
easy
look
science
exists
today
interpret
passages
match
those
findings
people
do
similar
things
sayings
nostradamus
all
time
anyway
rather
unique
claim
islam
may
worth
checking
