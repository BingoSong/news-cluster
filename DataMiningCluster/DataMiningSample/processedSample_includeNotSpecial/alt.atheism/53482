false
dichotomy
you
claimed
killing
were
religiously
motivated
i
m
saying
wrong
i
m
saying
each
every
killing
religiously
motivate
i
spelled
out
detail
which
killings
do
you
say
religously
motivated
example
i
would
claim
recent
assassination
four
catholic
construction
workers
who
had
connection
ira
probably
religously
motivated
time
writing
i
think
someone
who
claims
current
violence
motivated
religion
reaching
what
would
you
call
when
someone
writes
killings
n
i
religously
motivated
i
d
say
motivated
primitive
notion
revenge
misguided
patriotism
otherwise
i
d
have
wonder
how
come
mainland
catholics
killed
mainland
protestants
southern
catholics
killed
southern
protestants
so
take
away
all
plausible
causes
bar
religion
violence
diminishes
markedly
gee
why
now
possible
argue
religion
past
major
contributing
factor
violence
present
i
don
know
any
evidence
so
i
m
enough
historian
debate
given
avowed
aim
ira
take
northern
ireland
country
has
particular
church
written
its
constitution
which
has
restriction
civil
rights
dictated
church
i
fail
see
why
word
past
appropriate
country
also
has
different
official
language
written
its
constitution
vice
versa
maybe
re
motivated
love
irish
poetry
your
argument
fallacious
jon
what
worth
i
agree
all
you
say
about
ireland
above
