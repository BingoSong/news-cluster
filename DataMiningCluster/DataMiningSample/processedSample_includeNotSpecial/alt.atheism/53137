oh
wow
all
i
have
do
follow
christian
moral
standard
i
get
eternal
happiness
i
agree
many
cases
primitive
emotional
feelings
based
haha
you
won
laugh
hell
mentalities
makes
certain
religions
very
attractive
certain
personalities
i
agree
both
u
i
would
like
make
small
point
xtianity
other
dogmatic
religions
only
attract
people
without
hope
etc
also
attract
average
people
well
i
believe
xtainity
thru
its
escapist
doctrines
absolutist
attitudes
provides
great
psychological
shelter
from
day
day
frustrations
unhappiness
fear
uncertainty
unknown
etc
good
point
i
think
average
people
do
take
up
christianity
so
much
out
fear
escapism
quite
simply
way
improve
social
life
get
more
involved
american
culture
kids
immigrants
example
since
overwhelming
major
religion
western
world
some
form
other
simply
choice
people
take
bored
want
do
something
new
lives
somethong
too
new
too
out
ordinary
seems
little
weak
long
doesn
hurt
anybody
buddha
had
something
say
about
attractiveness
religions
when
driven
fear
man
worships
sacred
mountains
sacred
stones
sacred
trees
however
buddha
also
said
somebody
finds
peace
any
religion
let
him
good
quotes
i
agree
both
them
let
make
sure
alter
scond
one
so
includes
something
like
let
him
long
he
preventing
others
from
finding
peace
something
like
course
i
suppose
someone
were
really
peace
would
need
inflicting
evangelism
personally
i
feel
since
religion
have
poweful
psychological
effect
we
should
let
theists
problem
religions
cause
enormous
harm
non
believers
humanity
whole
holy
wars
inquisitions
inter
religious
hatred
impedence
science
intellectual
progress
us
them
attitudes
etc
etc
need
i
say
more
i
really
don
know
what
we
can
do
about
them
any
comments
well
sure
thing
we
have
live
them
all
our
lives
popularity
seems
come
go
i
remember
when
i
first
entered
high
school
i
atheist
always
had
been
so
were
about
my
friends
time
those
have
converted
always
christianity
were
all
also
immigrants
from
taiwan
sons
immigrants
hence
my
earlier
gross
generalization
christianity
seems
lot
more
popular
people
now
than
ever
has
before
since
i
ve
been
noticing
maybe
just
my
perceptions
chagning
who
knows
i
one
am
perfectly
willing
live
let
live
them
so
long
we
have
some
set
abstract
rights
agreements
how
we
should
treat
each
other
i
have
desire
hurt
them
notions
all
well
put
arguments
usenet
never
does
any
good
argumentation
does
really
seem
apply
christians
even
some
atheists
must
simply

almost
instinctively
