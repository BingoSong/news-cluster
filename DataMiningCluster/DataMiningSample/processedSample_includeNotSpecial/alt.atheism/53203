base
assumption
everyone
world
were
deprived
utterly
freedom
so
every
act
contrary
volition
almost
all
would
want
complain
therefore
i
take
assert
believe
freedom
very
valuable
when
almost
everyone
can
see
every

absurd
assert
raining
rainy
day
i
take
candidate
objective

necessary
condition
objective
morality
objective
values
exist
you
have
only
shown
vast
majority
all
would
agree
however
nothing

willing
trade
freedom
security
whatever

man
without
honor
keep
his
given
word
