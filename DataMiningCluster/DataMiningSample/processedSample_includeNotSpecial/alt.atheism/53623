may
well
feel
all
remains
some
moral

which
he
would
wish

hold
moral
opinion
he
suggests
know
something
true
have
preferences
regarding
human

those
preferences
should
include
terrorism
moral
opinion
true
likewise
preferences
should
include
noterrorism
moral
opinion
true
why
should
one
choose
set

which
include
terrorisim
over
one
which
includes

oh
