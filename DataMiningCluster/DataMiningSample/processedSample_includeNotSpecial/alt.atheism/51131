you
don
know
capital
punishment
wrong
so
isn
same
shooting
better
analogy
would
you
continue
drive
your
car
realizing
sooner
later
someone
going
killed
automobile
accident
you
know
people
get
killed
result
driving
yet
you
continue
do
anyway
uh
uh
you
do
know
you
one
do
killing
i
m
sure
i
d
drive
car
i
had
sufficient
evidence
conclude
i
would
necessarily
kill
someone
during
my
lifetime
yes
everyone
thinks
you
do
one
thinks
he
going
cause
involved
fatal
accident
likelihood
surprisingly
high
just
because
you
man
firing
squad
whose
gun
shooting
blanks
does
mean
you
less
guilty
i
don
know
about
jon
i
say
all
taking
human
life
murder
i
say
murder
wrong
all
one
situation
when
only
action
prevent
another
murder
either
myself
another
you
mean
killing
wrong
all
one
situtation
you
should
note
situation
never
occur
always
other
options
thank
killing
why
don
you
just
say
all
killing
wrong
basically
what
you
saying
i
m
getting
bit
tired
your
probabilistic
arguments
you
attempting
condescending
system
usually
works
pretty
well
small
consolation
poor
innocent
bastard
getting
lethal
injection
your
personal
value
human
life
based
solely
statistical
approach
you
sound
like
unswerving
adherent
needs
many
outweighing
needs
few
so
fuck
few
most
people
have
found
risk
acceptable
you
probably
much
more
likely
die
plane
crash
even
using
electric
blender
than
you
executed
innocent
i
personally
think
risk
acceptable
ideal
moral
system
risk
acceptable
acceptable
fudge
factor
necessary
approximation
ideal
