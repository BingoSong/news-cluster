false
dichotomy
you
claimed
killing
were
religiously
motivated
i
m
saying
wrong
i
m
saying
each
every
killing
religiously
motivate
i
spelled
out
detail
which
killings
do
you
say
religously
motivated
example
i
would
claim
recent
assassination
four
catholic
construction
workers
who
had
connection
ira
probably
religously
motivated
time
writing
i
think
someone
who
claims
current
violence
motivated
religion
reaching
what
would
you
call
when
someone
writes
killings
n
i
religously
motivated
now
possible
argue
religion
past
major
contributing
factor
violence
present
i
don
know
any
evidence
so
i
m
enough
historian
debate
given
avowed
aim
ira
take
northern
ireland
country
has
particular
church
written
its
constitution
which
has
restriction
civil
rights
dictated
church
i
fail
see
why
word
past
appropriate
claim
killings
n
i
religously
motivated
grotesque
all
means
church
believers
doing
what
always
do
history
can
face
rewrite
you
re
attacking
different
claim
my
claim
when
ira
terrorist
plants
bomb
warrington
he
does
have
motive
greater
glory
god
sorry
frank
what
i
put
quotes
your
own
words
from
your

de
don
tell
us
now
different
claim
you
can
longer
stand
behind
your
original
claim
just
say
so
i
mean
same
thing
when
i
say
killings
n
i
religously
motivated
i
do
when
i
say
when
terrorist
plants
bomb
he
doesn
have
religious
motive
example
meant
clarify
new
claim
different
claim
which
i
refer
claim
which
you
were
seemingly
attacking
previous
post
namely
religion
major
historical
cause
present
violence
i
don
assert
nor
do
i
assert
its
opposite
you
don
have
hand
us
bunch
double

i
seemingly
attacking
i
quoted
