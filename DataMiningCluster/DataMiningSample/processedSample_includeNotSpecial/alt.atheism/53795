therefore

we
also

problem
we
have

even
though
we
know

money

every

we
have
proven

because
we
have

potential

extremely
poor
argument
here
why

voila
screaming

my
highlights
sc
strawman
argument
only

distinguish
benefactor
from
bug
possible
evidence
bug
neither
evidence
benefactor
nor
true
say
hypothetical
universe
appears
exactly
were
benefactor
bug
two
statements
both
would
false
still
contradictory
reduces
alterian
dosh
arriving
my
account
due
benefactor
bug
evidence
benefactor
neither
evidence
bug
meaning
doesn
lend
more
weight
one
than
other
therefore
evidence
can
exist
benefactor
evidence
can
exist
bug
relies
shift
meaning
from
when
you
say
paraphrased
evidence
benefactor
example
what
you
mean
more
evidence
benefactor
than
bug
yes
what
i
mean
however
you
ve
shifted
meaning
evidence
benefactor
so
now
means
absolute
evidence
benefactor
rather
than
relative
evidence
benefactor
w
r
bug
really
i
meant
evidence
would
tend
one
over
other
i
think
just
communications
problem
what
i
am
trying
say
my
clumsy
way
while
i
buy
your
theory
far
relates
theism
making
predictions
prayer
your
rapture
example
i
don
buy
your
use
occam
razor
all
cases
where
my
example
one
couldn
dismiss
benefactor
bug
grounds
simplicity
one
necessary
explain
dosh
i
brought
up
one
one
dismissal
process
show
would
wrong
do
so
from
what
you
re
saying
post
seems
you
agree
we
re
talking
cross
purposes
still
contradiction
some
sums
may
help
b
benefactor
b
bug
d
dosh

account
implies
p
b
b
d
assuming
p
bb
d
so
either
benefactor
bug
which
responsible
bucks
arrive
both
p

p

so
p
b

p
b

what
i
meant
p
b
d
p
b
d
necessarily
new
observation
we
ve
already
seen
dosh
change
those
estimates
i
trying
say
again
my
clumsy
way
would
wrong
assign
probability
either
precisely
what
use
razor
does
case
gods
gods
one
class
hypothesis
many
others
belonging
set
hypotheses
one
which
necessary
explain
something
which
otherwise
would
satisfactorily
explained
can
thrown
out
retained
grounds
non
rational
preference
science
statistics
alternatively
one
could
chuck
out
retain
lot
grounds
answer
can
known
notional
probability
estimates
effectively
useless
being
equal
agnosticism
weak
atheism
do
when
set
m
filled
universe
caused
x
where
x
gods
pink
unicorns
nothing
etc
observation
tends
one
conclusion
over
other
exactly
point
i
making
i
think
so
we
don
throw
out
any
contrary
your
assertion
above
we
do
some
people
do
simon
think
doing
excellent
science
my
sole
point
aren
only
observations
which
directly
contradict
hypothesis
h
i
i
e
x
where
p
x
h
i
can
cause
p
h
i
go
zero
after
finite
number
observations
only
case
do
we
get
throw
any
hypotheses
out
exactly
my
point
though
i
may
have
been
unclear
you
said
diametric
opposite
which
i
guess
source
my
confusion
i
merely
trying
illustrate
incorrectness
doing
so
what
i
m
trying
say
while
you
correct
say
absence
evidence
can
sometimes
evidence
absence
does
hold
true
all
perhaps
any
versions
theism
isn
true
those
which
does
hold
can
discarded
using
razor
contrary
those
which
does
hold
exactly
those
which
can
discarded
using
razor
see
my
post
other
branch
thread
you
seem
guilty
contradiction
you
accuse
me
razor
holds
gods
holds
all
like
hypotheses
which
means
you
re
assigning
p
x
h
i
all
i
though
we
ve
already
established
correct
do
so
when
sum
p
x
h
i
over
all
i
simply
put
anyone
who
claims
have
viable
proof
existence
non
existence
gods
whether
inductive
best
mistaken
worst
barking
mad
luckily
i
make
claim
have
specifically
said
much
numerous
occasions
you
wouldn
constructing
strawman
here
would
you
frank
although
doesn
course
rule
out
my
being
barking
mad
any
case
i
could
barking
mad
my
spare
time
apologies
cleese
et
al
i
think
you
miss
point
once
again
when
i
say
something
evidence
against
hypothesis
doesn
imply
observation
said
something
necessarily
falsifies
hypothesis
reducing
estimate
p
h
data
zero
reduces
quantity
still
evidence
against
h
i
got
i
m
talking
about
case
when
you
re
clearly
correct
when
i
m
constructing
strawman
though
certainly
possible
i
ve
misunderstood
what
you
re
saying
however
any
standards
system
says
when
gods
highly
unlikely
when
gods
can
dismissed
using
razor
system
purporting
inductive
proof
gods
either
don
exist
unnecessary
explain
any
all
phenomena
my
experience
systems
including
those
which
purport
prove
gods
exist
always
contain
fallacy
upon
close
examination
what
you
re
saying
please
put
me
straight
