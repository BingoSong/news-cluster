article
attempts
provide
general
introduction
atheism
whilst
i
have
tried
neutral
possible
regarding
contentious
issues
you
should
always
remember
document
represents
only
one
viewpoint
i
would
encourage
you
read
widely
draw
your
own
conclusions
some
relevant
books
listed
companion
article
provide
sense
cohesion
progression
i
have
presented
article
imaginary
conversation
between
atheist
theist
all
questions
asked
imaginary
theist
questions
which
have
been
cropped
up
repeatedly
alt
atheism
since
newsgroup
created
some
other
frequently
asked
questions
answered
companion
article
please
note
article
arguably
slanted
towards
answering
questions
posed
from
christian
viewpoint
because
faq
files
reflect
questions
which
have
actually
been
asked
predominantly
christians
who
proselytize
alt
atheism
so
when
i
talk
religion
i
am
talking
primarily
about
religions
christianity
judaism
islam
which
involve
some
sort
superhuman
divine
being
much
discussion
apply
other
religions
some
may
what
atheism
atheism
characterized
absence
belief
existence
god
some
atheists
go
further
believe
god
does
exist
former
often
referred
weak
atheist
position
latter
strong
atheism
important
note
difference
between
two
positions
weak
atheism
simple
scepticism
disbelief
existence
god
strong
atheism
positive
belief
god
does
exist
please
do
fall
trap
assuming
all
atheists
strong
atheists
some
atheists
believe
non
existence
all
gods
others
limit
atheism
specific
gods
christian
god
rather
than
making
flat
out
denials
isn
disbelieving
god
same
thing
believing
he
doesn
exist
definitely
disbelief
proposition
means
one
does
believe
true
believing
something
true
equivalent
believing
false
one
may
simply
have
idea
whether
true
which
brings
us
agnosticism
what
agnosticism
term
agnosticism
coined
professor
huxley
meeting
metaphysical
society
he
defined
agnostic
someone
who
disclaimed
strong
atheism
believed
ultimate
origin
things
must
some
cause
unknown
unknowable
thus
agnostic
someone
who
believes
we
do
cannot
know
sure
whether
god
exists
words
slippery
things
language
inexact
beware
assuming
you
can
work
out
someone
philosophical
point
view
simply
from
fact
she
calls
herself
atheist
agnostic
example
many
people
use
agnosticism
mean
weak
atheism
use
word
atheism
only
when
referring
strong
atheism
beware
also
because
word
atheist
has
so
many
shades
meaning
very
difficult
generalize
about
atheists
about
all
you
can
say
sure
atheists
don
believe
god
example
certainly
isn
case
all
atheists
believe
science
best
way
find
out
about
universe
so
what
philosophical
justification
basis
atheism
many
philosophical
justifications
atheism
find
out
why
particular
person
chooses
atheist
best
ask
her
many
atheists
feel
idea
god
presented
major
religions
essentially
self
contradictory
logically
impossible
god
could
exist
others
atheists
through
scepticism
because
see
evidence
god
exists
isn
impossible
prove
non
existence
something
many
counter
examples
statement
example
quite
simple
prove
does
exist
prime
number
larger
than
all
other
prime
numbers
course
deals
well
defined
objects
obeying
well
defined
rules
whether
gods
universes
similarly
well
defined
matter
debate
however
assuming
moment
existence
god
provably
impossible
still
subtle
reasons
assuming
non
existence
god
we
assume
something
does
exist
always
possible
show
assumption
invalid
finding
single
counter
example
other
hand
we
assume
something
does
exist
thing
question
provably
impossible
showing
assumption
invalid
may
require
exhaustive
search
all
possible
places
where
thing
might
found
show
isn
exhaustive
search
often
impractical
impossible
problem
largest
primes
because
we
can
prove
don
exist
therefore
generally
accepted
we
must
assume
things
do
exist
unless
we
have
evidence
do
even
theists
follow
rule
most
time
don
believe
unicorns
even
though
can
conclusively
prove
unicorns
exist
anywhere
assume
god
exists
make
assumption
which
probably
cannot
tested
we
cannot
make
exhaustive
search
everywhere
god
might
prove
he
doesn
exist
anywhere
so
sceptical
atheist
assumes
default
god
does
exist
since
assumption
we
can
test
those
who
profess
strong
atheism
usually
do
claim
sort
god
exists
instead
generally
restrict
claims
so
cover
varieties
god
described
followers
various
religions
so
whilst
may
impossible
prove
conclusively
god
exists
may
possible
prove
say
god
described
particular
religious
book
does
exist
may
even
possible
prove
god
described
any
present
day
religion
exists
practice
believing
god
described
any
religion
exists
very
close
believing
god
exists
however
sufficiently
different
counter
arguments
based
impossibility
disproving
every
kind
god
really
applicable
what
god
essentially
non
detectable
god
interacts
our
universe
any
way
effects
his
interaction
must
measurable
hence
his
interaction
our
universe
must
detectable
god
essentially
non
detectable
must
therefore
case
he
does
interact
our
universe
any
way
many
atheists
would
argue
god
does
interact
our
universe
all
importance
whether
he
exists
bible
believed
god
easily
detectable
israelites
surely
he
should
still
detectable
today
note
i
am
demanding
god
interact
scientifically
verifiable
physical
way
must
surely
possible
perceive
some
effect
caused
his
presence
though
otherwise
how
can
i
distinguish
him
from
all
other
things
don
exist
ok
you
may
think
philosophical
justification
atheism
isn
still
religious
belief
one
most
common
pastimes
philosophical
discussion
redefinition
game
cynical
view
game
follows

making
contentious

b
points

tend

digression
answer
question
isn
atheism
religious
belief
depends
crucially
upon
what
meant
religious
religion
generally
characterized
belief
superhuman
controlling
power
especially
some
sort
god
faith
worship
worth
pointing
out
passing
some
varieties
buddhism
religion
according
definition
atheism
certainly
belief
any
sort
superhuman
power
nor
categorized
worship
any
meaningful
sense
widening
definition
religious
encompass
atheism
tends
result
many
other
aspects
human
behaviour
suddenly
becoming
classed
religious
well
science
politics
watching
tv
ok
so
religion
surely
belief
atheism
science
still
just
act
faith
like
religion
firstly
entirely
clear
sceptical
atheism
something
one
actually
believes
secondly
necessary
adopt
number
core
beliefs
assumptions
make
some
sort
sense
out
sensory
data
we
experience
most
atheists
try
adopt
few
core
beliefs
possible
even
those
subject
questioning
experience
throws
them
doubt
science
has
number
core
assumptions
example
generally
assumed
laws
physics
same
all
observers
sort
core
assumptions
atheists
make
basic
ideas
called
acts
faith
almost
everything
we
know
must
said
based
acts
faith
term
loses
its
meaning
faith
more
often
used
refer
complete
certain
belief
something
according
definition
atheism
science
certainly
acts
faith
course
individual
atheists
scientists
can
dogmatic
religious
followers
when
claiming
something
certain
general
tendency
however
many
atheists
who
would
reluctant
state
certainty
universe
exists
faith
also
used
refer
belief
without
supporting
evidence
proof
sceptical
atheism
certainly
doesn
fit
definition
sceptical
atheism
has
beliefs
strong
atheism
closer
still
doesn
really
match
even
most
dogmatic
atheist
tend
refer
experimental
data
lack
when
asserting
god
does
exist
atheism
religious
surely
anti
religious
unfortunate
human
tendency
label
everyone
either
against
friend
enemy
truth
so
clear
cut
atheism
position
runs
logically
counter
theism
sense
can
said
anti
religion
however
when
religious
believers
speak
atheists
being
anti
religious
usually
mean
atheists
have
some
sort
antipathy
hatred
towards
theists
categorization
atheists
hostile
towards
religion
quite
unfair
atheist
attitudes
towards
theists
fact
cover
broad
spectrum
most
atheists
take
live
let
live
attitude
unless
questioned
usually
mention
atheism
except
perhaps
close
friends
course
may
part
because
atheism
socially
acceptable
many
countries
few
atheists
quite
anti
religious
may
even
try
convert
others
when
possible
historically
anti
religious
atheists
have
made
little
impact
society
outside
eastern
bloc
countries
digress
slightly
soviet
union
originally
dedicated
separation
church
state
just
like
usa
soviet
citizens
were
legally
free
worship
wished
institution
state
atheism
came
about
when
stalin
took
control
soviet
union
tried
destroy
churches
order
gain
complete
power
over
population
some
atheists
quite
vocal
about
beliefs
only
where
see
religion
encroaching
matters
which
its
business
example
government
usa
individuals
usually
concerned
church
state
should
remain
separate
you
don
allow
religion
have
say
running
state
surely
same
state
atheism
principle
separation
church
state
state
shall
legislate
concerning
matters
religious
belief
particular
means
only
state
cannot
promote
one
religion
expense
another
also
cannot
promote
any
belief
which
religious
nature
religions
can
still
have
say
discussion
purely
secular
matters
example
religious
believers
have
historically
been
responsible
encouraging
many
political
reforms
even
today
many
organizations
campaigning
increase
spending
foreign
aid
founded
religious
campaigns
so
long
campaign
concerning
secular
matters
so
long
do
discriminate
religious
grounds
most
atheists
quite
happy
see
them
have
say
what
about
prayer
schools
god
why
do
you
care
people
pray
because
people
who
do
pray
voters
lawmakers
tend
do
things
those
who
don
pray
can
just
ignore
also
christian
prayer
schools
intimidating
non
christians
even
told
need
join
diversity
religious
non
religious
belief
means
impossible
formulate
meaningful
prayer
acceptable
all
those
present
any
public
event
also
non
prayers
tend
have
friends
family
who
pray
reasonable
care
about
friends
family
wasting
time
even
without
other
motives
you
mentioned
christians
who
campaign
increased
foreign
aid
what
about
atheists
why
aren
any
atheist
charities
hospitals
don
atheists
object
religious
charities
many
charities
without
religious
purpose
atheists
can
contribute
some
atheists
contribute
religious
charities
well
sake
practical
good
do
some
atheists
even
do
voluntary
work
charities
founded
theistic
basis
most
atheists
seem
feel
atheism
isn
worth
shouting
about
connection
charity
them
atheism
just
simple
obvious
everyday
matter
so
charity
many
feel
somewhat
cheap
say
self
righteous
use
simple
charity
excuse
plug
particular
set
religious
beliefs
weak
atheists
building
hospital
say
i
do
believe
god
rather
strange
idea
rather
like
holding
party
say
today
my
birthday
why
fuss
atheism
rarely
evangelical
you
said
atheism
isn
anti
religious
perhaps
backlash
against
one
upbringing
way
rebelling
perhaps
some
many
people
have
parents
who
do
attempt
force
any
religious
atheist
ideas
upon
them
many
those
people
choose
call
themselves
atheists
also
doubtless
case
some
religious
people
chose
religion
backlash
against
atheist
upbringing
way
being
different
other
hand
many
people
choose
religion
way
conforming
expectations
others
whole
we
can
conclude
much
about
whether
atheism
religion
backlash
conformism
although
general
people
have
tendency
go
along
group
rather
than
act
think
independently
how
do
atheists
differ
from
religious
people
don
believe
god
all
atheists
may
listen
heavy
metal
backwards
even
may
prefer
verdi
requiem
even
know
words
may
wear
hawaiian
shirts
may
dress
all
black
may
even
wear
orange
robes
many
buddhists
lack
belief
any
sort
god
some
atheists
even
carry
copy
bible
around
arguing
against
course
whoever
you
chances
you
have
met
several
atheists
without
realising
atheists
usually
unexceptional
behaviour
appearance
unexceptional
aren
atheists
less
moral
than
religious
people
depends
you
define
morality
obedience
god
course
atheists
less
moral
don
obey
any
god
usually
when
one
talks
morality
one
talks
what
acceptable
right
unacceptable
wrong
behaviour
within
society
humans
social
animals
maximally
successful
must
co
operate
each
other
good
enough
reason
discourage
most
atheists
from
anti
social
immoral
behaviour
purely
purposes
self
preservation
many
atheists
behave
moral
compassionate
way
simply
because
feel
natural
tendency
empathize
other
humans
so
why
do
care
what
happens
others
don
know
simply
way
naturally
some
people
who
behave
immorally
try
use
atheism
justify
actions
however
equally
many
people
who
behave
immorally
try
use
religious
beliefs
justify
actions
example
here
trustworthy
saying
deserves
full
acceptance
jesus
christ
came
world
save
sinners
very
reason
i
shown
mercy
so
me
jesus
christ
might
display
his
unlimited
patience
example
those
who
would
believe
him
receive
eternal
life
now
king
eternal
immortal
invisible
only
god
honor
glory
forever
ever
above
quote
from
statement
made

february
th
jeffrey
dahmer
notorious

seems
every
atheist
mass
murderer
religious
mass
murderer
what
more
trivial
morality
survey
conducted
roper
organization
found
behavior
deteriorated
after
born
again
experiences
while
only
respondents
said
had
driven
intoxicated
before
being
born
again
had
done
so
after
conversion
similarly
had
used
illegal
drugs
before
conversion
after

percent
admitted
engaging

today
september
p
so
seems
best
religion
does
have
monopoly
moral
behaviour
thing
atheist
morality
you
mean
thing
morality
atheists
answer
yes
explained
above
many
atheists
have
ideas
about
morality
which
least
strong
those
held
religious
people
you
mean
does
atheism
have
characteristic
moral
code
answer
atheism
itself
does
imply
anything
much
about
how
person
behave
most
atheists
follow
many
same
moral
rules
theists
different
reasons
atheists
view
morality
something
created
humans
according
way
humans
feel
world
ought
work
rather
than
seeing
set
rules
decreed
supernatural
being
aren
atheists
just
theists
who
denying
god
study
freedom
from
religion
foundation
found
over
atheists
who
responded
became
atheists
because
religion
did
work
them
had
found
religious
beliefs
were
fundamentally
incompatible
what
observed
around
them
atheists
unbelievers
through
ignorance
denial
unbelievers
through
choice
vast
majority
them
have
spent
time
studying
one
more
religions
sometimes
very
great
depth
have
made
careful
considered
decision
reject
religious
beliefs
decision
may
course
inevitable
consequence
individual
personality
naturally
sceptical
person
choice
atheism
often
only
one
makes
sense
hence
only
choice
person
can
honestly
make
don
atheists
want
believe
god
atheists
live
lives
though
nobody
watching
over
them
many
them
have
desire
watched
over
matter
how
good
natured
big
brother
figure
might
some
atheists
would
like
able
believe
god
so
what
should
one
believe
things
merely
because
one
wants
them
true
risks
approach
should
obvious
atheists
often
decide
wanting
believe
something
enough
must
evidence
belief
course
atheists
see
evidence
existence
god
unwilling
souls
see
many
most
atheists
were
previously
religious
has
been
explained
above
vast
majority
have
seriously
considered
possibility
god
exists
many
atheists
have
spent
time
prayer
trying
reach
god
course
true
some
atheists
lack
open
mind
assuming
all
atheists
biased
insincere
offensive
closed
minded
comments
course
god
you
just
aren
looking
properly
likely
viewed
patronizing
certainly
you
wish
engage
philosophical
debate
atheists
vital
you
give
them
benefit
doubt
assume
being
sincere
say
have
searched
god
you
willing
believe
basically
telling
truth
debate
futile
isn
whole
life
completely
pointless
atheist
many
atheists
live
purposeful
life
decide
what
think
gives
meaning
life
pursue
those
goals
try
make
lives
count
wishing
eternal
life
having
influence
other
people
who
live
example
atheist
may
dedicate
his
life
political
reform
hope
leaving
his
mark
history
natural
human
tendency
look
meaning
purpose
random
events
however
means
obvious
life
sort
thing
has
meaning
put
another
way
everything
which
looks
like
question
actually
sensible
thing
ask
some
atheists
believe
asking
what
meaning
life
silly
asking
what
meaning
cup
coffee
believe
life
has
purpose
meaning
just
so
how
do
atheists
find
comfort
time
danger
many
ways
obtaining
comfort
from
family
friends
even
pets
less
spiritual
level
from
food
drink
tv
may
sound
rather
empty
vulnerable
way
face
danger
so
what
should
individuals
believe
things
because
comforting
should
face
reality
matter
how
harsh
might
end
decision
individual
concerned
most
atheists
unable
believe
something
would
otherwise
believe
merely
because
makes
them
feel
comfortable
put
truth
before
comfort
consider
searching
truth
sometimes
makes
them
feel
unhappy
just
hard
luck
don
atheists
worry
might
suddenly
shown
wrong
short
answer
do
you
many
atheists
have
been
atheists
years
have
encountered
many
arguments
much
supposed
evidence
existence
god
have
found
all
invalid
inconclusive
thousands
years
religious
belief
haven
resulted
any
good
proof
existence
god
atheists
therefore
tend
feel
unlikely
proved
wrong
immediate
future
stop
worrying
about
so
why
should
theists
question
beliefs
don
same
arguments
apply
because
beliefs
being
questioned
similar
weak
atheism
sceptical
default
position
take
asserts
nothing
strong
atheism
negative
belief
theism
very
strong
positive
belief
atheists
sometimes
also
argue
theists
should
question
beliefs
because
very
real
harm
can
cause
just
believers
everyone
else
what
sort
harm
religion
represents
huge
financial
work
burden
mankind
just
matter
religious
believers
wasting
money
church
buildings
think
all
time
effort
spent
building
churches
praying
so
imagine
how
effort
could
better
spent
many
theists
believe
miracle
healing
have
been
plenty
instances
ill
people
being
healed
priest
ceasing
take
medicines
prescribed
them
doctors
dying
result
some
theists
have
died
because
have
refused
blood
transfusions
religious
grounds
arguable
catholic
church
opposition
birth
control
condoms
particular
increasing
problem
overpopulation
many
third
world
countries
contributing
spread
aids
world
wide
religious
believers
have
been
known
murder
children
rather
than
allow
children
become
atheists
marry
someone
different
religion
those
weren
real
believers
just
claimed
believers
some
sort
excuse
what
makes
real
believer
so
many
one
true
religions
hard
tell
look
christianity
many
competing
groups
all
convinced
only
true
christians
sometimes
even
fight
kill
each
other
how
atheist
supposed
decide
who
real
christian
who
isn
when
even
major
christian
churches
like
catholic
church
church
england
can
decide
amongst
themselves
end
most
atheists
take
pragmatic
view
decide
anyone
who
calls
himself
christian
uses
christian
belief
dogma
justify
his
actions
should
considered
christian
maybe
some
those
christians
just
perverting
christian
teaching
own
ends
surely
bible
can
so
readily
used
support
un
christian
acts
can
much
moral
code
bible
word
god
why
couldn
he
have
made
less
easy
misinterpret
how
do
you
know
your
beliefs
aren
perversion
what
your
god
intended
single
unambiguous
interpretation
bible
why
should
atheist
take
one
interpretation
over
another
just
your
say
so
sorry
someone
claims
he
believes
jesus
he
murdered
others
because
jesus
bible
told
him
do
so
we
must
call
him
christian
obviously
those
extreme
sorts
beliefs
should
questioned
since
nobody
has
ever
proved
god
does
exist
must
very
unlikely
more
basic
religious
beliefs
shared
all
faiths
nonsense
does
hold
because
pointed
out
start
dialogue
positive
assertions
concerning
existence
entities
inherently
much
harder
disprove
than
negative
ones
nobody
has
ever
proved
unicorns
don
exist
doesn
make
unlikely
myths
therefore
much
more
valid
hold
negative
assertion
default
than
hold
positive
assertion
default
course
weak
atheists
would
argue
asserting
nothing
better
still
well
atheism
so
great
why
so
many
theists
unfortunately
popularity
belief
has
little
do
how
correct
whether
works
consider
how
many
people
believe
astrology
graphology
other
pseudo
sciences
many
atheists
feel
simply
human
weakness
want
believe
gods
certainly
many
primitive
human
societies
religion
allows
people
deal
phenomena
do
adequately
understand
course
more
religion
than
industrialized
world
we
find
people
believing
religious
explanations
phenomena
even
when
perfectly
adequate
natural
explanations
religion
may
have
started
means
attempting
explain
world
nowadays
serves
other
purposes
well
so
many
cultures
have
developed
religions
surely
must
say
something
really
most
religions
only
superficially
similar
example
worth
remembering
religions
buddhism
taoism
lack
any
sort
concept
god
christian
sense
course
most
religions
quick
denounce
competing
religions
so
rather
odd
use
one
religion
try
justify
another
what
about
all
famous
scientists
philosophers
who
have
concluded
god
exists
every
scientist
philosopher
who
believes
god
one
who
does
besides
has
already
been
pointed
out
truth
belief
determined
how
many
people
believe
also
important
realize
atheists
do
view
famous
scientists
philosophers
same
way
theists
view
religious
leaders
famous
scientist
only
human
she
may
expert
some
fields
when
she
talks
about
other
matters
her
words
carry
special
weight
many
respected
scientists
have
made
themselves
look
foolish
speaking
subjects
which
lie
outside
fields
expertise
so
you
really
saying
widespread
belief
religion
indicates
nothing
entirely
certainly
indicates
religion
question
has
properties
which
have
helped
so
spread
so
far
theory
memetics
talks
memes
sets
ideas
which
can
propagate
themselves
between
human
minds
analogy
genes
some
atheists
view
religions
sets
particularly
successful
parasitic
memes
which
spread
encouraging
hosts
convert
others
some
memes
avoid
destruction
discouraging
believers
from
questioning
doctrine
using
peer
pressure
keep
one
time
believers
from
admitting
were
mistaken
some
religious
memes
even
encourage
hosts
destroy
hosts
controlled
other
memes
course
memetic
view
particular
virtue
associated
successful
propagation
meme
religion
good
thing
because
number
people
who
believe
any
more
than
disease
good
thing
because
number
people
who
have
caught
even
religion
entirely
true
least
puts
across
important
messages
what
fundamental
messages
atheism
many
important
ideas
atheists
promote
following
just
few
them
don
surprised
see
ideas
which
also
present
some
religions
more
moral
behaviour
than
mindlessly
following
rules
especially
sceptical
positive
claims
you
want
your
life
have
some
sort
meaning
up
you
find
search
what
true
even
makes
you
uncomfortable
make
most
your
life
probably
only
one
you
ll
have
good
relying
some
external
power
change
you
you
must
change
yourself
just
because
something
popular
doesn
mean
good
you
must
assume
something
assume
something
easy
test
don
believe
things
just
because
you
want
them
true
finally
most
importantly
all
beliefs
should
open
question
