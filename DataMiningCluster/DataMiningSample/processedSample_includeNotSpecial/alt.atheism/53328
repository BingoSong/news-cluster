wrote
some
stuff
about
biblical
morality
though
bill
quote
me
had
little
do
what
he
goes
say
bill
i
m
sorry
have
been
busy
lately
only
just
getting
around
apparently
you
have
some
fundamental
confusions
about
atheism
i
think
many
well
addressed
famous
faq
your
generalisms
misplaced
atheism
needn
imply
materialism
lack
absolute
moral
system
however
i
do
tend
materialism
don
believe
absolute
morality
so
i
ll
answer
your
questions
how
can
atheist
judge
value
atheist
judges
value
same
way
theist
does
according
personal
understanding
morality
i
don
believe
absolute
one
doesn
mean
i
don
have
one
i
m
just
explicit
line
postings
you
followed
up
when
i
express
judgment
moral
issue
i
am
basing
my
judgment
my
own
code
rather
than
claiming
some
absolute
sense
good
bad
my
moral
code
particular
different
from
others
around
me
christians
muslims
atheists
so
when
i
say
i
object
genocide
i
m
expressing
anything
particularly
out
line
what
my
society
holds
your
were
ask
why
i
think
morality
exists
has
form
does
my
answer
would
mechanistic
your
taste
moral
code
prerequisite
functioning
society
humanity
probably
evolved
morality
we
know
part
evolution
our
ability
exist
large
societies
thereby
achieving
considerable
survival
advantages
you
d
probably
say
god
just
made
rules
neither
us
can
convince
other
we
share
common
understanding
about
many
moral
issues
you
think
you
get
from
your
religion
i
think
i
get
you
get
from
early
childhood
teaching
you
don
like
what
god
told
people
do
says
nothing
about
god
god
commands
says
only
electrical
event
your
nervous
system
created
emotional
state
your
mind
coupled
pre
existing
thought
set
form
reaction
i
think
you
ve
been
reading
wrong
sort
comic
books
prying
through
gobbledygook
i
basically
agree
what
you
re
saying
i
do
believe
my
mental
reactions
stimuli
god
commanded
genocide
canaanites
mechanistic
course
i
think
true
you
well
my
reaction
has
little
do
whether
god
exists
even
whether
i
think
he
does
god
existed
who
commanded
genocide
i
could
consider
him
good
which
supposedly
attribute
god
all
being
so
you
have
excluded
yourself
from
any
discussion
values
right
wrong
goood
evil
etc
cannot
participate
your
opinion
about
bible
can
have
weight
whatsoever
hmm
yes
i
think
some
heavy
faq
reading
would
do
you
some
good
i
have
much
place
discussing
values
etc
any
other
person
fact
i
can
actually
accomplish
something
discussion
framing
questions
terms
reason
instance
clear
environment
where
neighboring
tribes
periodically
attempt
wipe
each
other
out
based
imagined
divine
commands
quality
life
generally
poor
so
system
fosters
coexistence
superior
quality
life
agreed
goal
absolutist
other
hand
can
only
thump
those
portions
bible
happen
agree
say
good
even
act
question
unequivocally
bad
standards
everyone
discussion
attempt
define
someone
group
people
excluded
from
discussion
cannot
participate
opinions
given
weight
whatsoever
lowest
form
reasoning
ad
hominem
poisoning
well
presumably
resort
someone
who
can
rationally
defend
own
ideas
right
wrong
