so
firstly
apology
you
hadn

mistaken
saying
you
had
sorry
any
offence
caused
secondly
how
can
i
refute
your

up
its
logical
implications

contradict

indeed
your

objective
x
oxymoron
all

i
have
quibble
belief
other
than
useless

anyway
i
show
above
how
many
ages
can
universe
have
still

i
d
amazed
more
than

how
many
different

can
different

society
have
indeed

some

still

opinions
about
age

humanity
can
still

about
why
