i
just
borrowed
book
from
library
khomeini
fatwa
etc
i
found
useful
passage
regarding
legitimacy
fatwa
also
common
knowledge
prescribed
islamic
law
sentence
only
applicable
where
jurisdiction
islamic
law
applies
moreover
sentence
has
passed
islamic
court
executed
state
machinery
through
due
process
law
even
islamic
countries
let
alone
non
muslim
lands
individuals
cannot
take
law
own
hands
sentence
when
passed
must
carried
out
state
through
usual
machinery
individuals
indeed
becomes
criminal
act
take
law
one
own
hands
punish
offender
unless
process
self
defence
moreover
offender
must
brought
notice
court
court
who
shoud
decide
how
deal
him
law
applies
equally
muslim
well
non
muslim
territories
i
agree
fully
above
statement
precisely
what
i
meant
my
previous
statements
about
islam
being
anarchist
law
being
enforcible
despite
law
being
applicable
hence
clarification
from
ulama
islamic
scholars
muslims
britain
before
after
imam
khomeini
fatwa
made
very
clear
since
islamic
law
applicable
britain
hadd
compulsory
punishment
cannot
applied
here
i
disagree
conclusion
about
applicability
islamic
law
all
muslims
wherever
may
above
conclusion
does
strictly
follow
from
foregoing
only
conclusion
fatwa
cannot
enforced
according
islamic
law
however
i
do
agree
punishment
cannot
applied
rushdie
even
were
well
founded
wow
from
above
looks
like
from
islamic
viewpoint
khomeini
fatwa
constitutes
criminal
act
perhaps
i
could
even
go
out
limb
call
khomeini
criminal
basis
certainly
putting
price
head
rushdie
britain
criminal
act
according
islamic
law
anyhow
i
think
understood
knowledgeable
muslims
khomeini
fatwa
islamically
illegitimate
least
basis
expounded
above
others
myself
others
who
have
posted
here
particularly
umar
khan
gregg
jaeger
i
think
go
further
say
even
punishment
constituted
fatwa
against
islamic
law
according
our
understanding
yes
