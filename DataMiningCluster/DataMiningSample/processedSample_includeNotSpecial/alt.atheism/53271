saving

bit

i
copy
koran
quote
he
god
almighty
who
created
night
day
sun
earth
all
celetial
bodies
swim
along
each
its
rounded
course
holy
quran
has
been
pointed
out
quote
makes
claim
about
what
orbits
what
idea
something
orbited
something
had
been
held
true
many
years
before
koran
written
so
fact
says
something
orbits
something
hardly
surprising
insight
my
concern
word
rounded
two
interpretations
word
means
circle
wrong
although
many
believed
true
time
koran
written
other
words
describing
our
neighborhood
universe
really
exists
thought
time
has
implications
which
i
hope
obvious
everyone
means
rounded
shape
which
could
include
elipses
geometrical
form
which
most
nearly
describes
orbits
planets
also
great
insight
look
shapes
you
see
nature
very
few
them
even
approach
square
rectangle
those
human
created
shapes
everything
nature
rounded
some
degree
even
flat
earthers
don
try
claim
earth
rectangle
children
who
draw
imaginary
animals
seldom
give
them
rectangular
bodies
we
seem
instinctively
recognize
nature
produces
rounded
shapes
hence
assumption
orbits
planets
would
round
hardly
takes
divine
inspiration
good
remember
every
translation
some
extent
interpretation
so
you
point
out
below
one
must
really
go
back
original
arabic
regarding
verses
relevant
nature
i
prefer
use
dr
maurice
bucaille
translations
his
book
bible
qur
science
general
his
translations
more
literal
maurice
bucaille
translates
portion
verse
you
addressing
each
one
travelling
orbit
its
own
motion
also
note
celestial
bodies
first
translation
quoted
you
above
translator
interpolation
existent
original
arabic
which
why
included
brackets
perhaps
someone
who
can
read
original
arabic
can
eliminate
one
interpretations
any
rate
neither
one
them
exactly
impressive
you
re
right
what
verses
do
contain
isn
all
remarkable
however
dr
bucaille
surgeon
how
he
dr
thinks
significant
above
verse
contains
geocentric
ideas
even
though
geocentrism
all
rage
up
until
th
century
so
goes
rest
qur
well
which
has
about
verses
so
regarding
nature
i
think
i
remember
reading
once
