anyone
heard
from
graham
matthews

he
gotten
his
degree
sailed
greener
pastures

which
brings
me
point
my
posting
how
many
people

have
been
around
alt
atheism
since
i
ve
done
my
damnedest
stay
top

you
fall
behind

really
fall
behind
still
bad
rec
arts
startrek
used

deluge
inquiring
minds

i
am
one
those
people
who
always
willl
have
unlimited
stores
unfounded
respect
people
who
have
been
newsgroups
mailing

have
so
you
certainly
have
my
sympathy

have
only
been
semi
regularly

since
february
i
have
been
reading
following

since
last
august
my
school
newsreader
down
months
our
incompetent
computing
services
never
bothered
find
new
feed
