i
argue
your
latter
statement
i
believe
gods
exist
does
rest
upon
faith
you
making
positive
statement
gods
exist
strong
atheism
rather
than
merely
saying
i
don
know
therefore
don
believe
them
don
believe
weak
atheism
once
again
believe
god
different
than
saying
i
believe
god
does
exist
i
still
maintain
position
even
after
reading
faqs
strong
atheism
requires
faith
way
usually
used
my
view
you
saying
here
driving
car
requires
faith
car
drives
i
m
saying
all
requires
faith
my
part
say
car
drives
because
i
ve
seen
drive
i
ve
done
more
than
fact
i
ve
actually
driven
now
what
does
require
some
faith
belief
my
senses
give
accurate
representation
what
out
evidence
pro
con
existence
non
existence
god
see
what
i
have
say
below
me
conclusion
i
have
more
faith
than
i
have
premises
argument
used
sorry
i
remain
skeptical
i
don
believe
entirely
conclusion
you
have
seen
evidence
god
correct
neither
have
i
lack
evidence
existence
something
way
evidence
non
existence
something
creationist
have
similar
mode
argumentation
which
disprove
evolution
establish
creation
you
personally
have
never
seen
neutrino
before
exist
pink
unicorn
analogy
breaks
down
rather
naive
i
have
scientific
theory
explains
appearance
animal
life
evolution
when
i
draw
conclusion
pink
unicorns
don
exist
because
i
haven
seen
them
conclusion
has
foundation
observation
theory
pink
unicorn
did
exist
would
qualitatively
similar
other
known
entities
say
since
good
evidence
all
life
earth
has
evolved
from
more
primitive
ancestors
pink
unicorns
would
share
common
anscestory
horses
zebras
god
however
has
correspondence
anything
imo
physical
frame
work
observation
draw
any
conclusions
from
first
let
me
say
following
we
might
have
language
problem
here
regards
faith
existence
i
christian
maintain
god
does
exist
exist
means
have
being
space
time
god
does
have
being
god
being
kierkegaard
once
said
god
does
exist
he
eternal
said
i
feel
rather
pointless
debate
so
called
existence
god
what
i
m
doing
here
i
believe
god
source
ground
being
when
you
say
god
does
exist
i
also
accept
statement
we
obviously
mean
two
different
things
however
what
follows
i
use
phrase
existence
god
usual
sense
sense
i
think
you
using
i
would
like
clarification
upon
what
you
mean
existence
god
word
game
i
disagree
you
profoundly
i
haven
defined
god
existence
fact
i
haven
defined
god
might
getting
off
subject
although
you
think
relevant
we
can
come
back
further
saying
god
existence
either
waste
time
existence
already
used
need
replace
god
you
implying
more
which
case
your
definition
your
argument
so
far
incomplete
making
fallacy
you
using
wrong
categories
here
perhaps
you
misunderstand
what
i
m
saying
i
m
making
argument
what
so
ever
offering
definition
so
fallacy
i
m
trying
convince
you
anything
i
believe
rests
upon
faith
inappropriate
apply
category
logic
realm
unless
someone
tells
you
can
logically
prove
god
have
evidence
use
logic
disprove
claims
fine
necessary
btw
incomplete
argument
fallacy
some
things
even
wrong
deletion
one
can
never
prove
god
does
does
exist
when
you
say
you
believe
god
does
exist
opinion
based
upon
observation
i
have
ask
what
observtions
you
refering
observations
pro
con
valid
here
establishing
positive
belief
deletion
where
does
follow
aren
observations
based
assumption
something
exists
i
don
follow
you
here
certainly
one
can
make
observations
things
didn
know
existed
i
still
maintain
one
cannot
use
observation
infer
god
does
exist
positive
assertion
requires
leap
wouldn
you
say
level
definition
assumption
god
meaningful
i
would
reject
concept
anyway
so
where
your
evidence
god
meaningful
some
level
once
again
you
seem
completely
misunderstand
me
i
have
evidence
god
meaningful
any
level
maybe
response
you
gave
just
comes
naturally
you
because
so
many
people
try
run
own
private
conception
god
down
your
throat
i
however
am
doing
i
am
arguing
one
only
one
thing
make
positive
assertion
about
something
which
can
principle
evidence
against
requires
leap
requires
faith
i
am
you
would
say
theist
however
form
atheism
i
can
respect
must
founded
upon
honesty
