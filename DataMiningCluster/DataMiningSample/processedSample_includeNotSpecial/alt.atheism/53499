best

isn
i
realize
i
m
fighting

so
i
ll
try
explain
why
i
feel
mind
necessary
kevin
unfortunately
you
now
delving
field
i
know
too
little
about
algorithms
your
reasoning
i
see
very
much
along
lines
roger
penrose
who
claimed
mathematical
insight
cannot
algorithmic
his
book
emperor
new
mind
concerning
computers
minds
laws
physics
however
penrose
claim
he
has
mathematical
insight
your
similar
claim
wavefunctions
collapse
only
when
we
consciously
take
look
could
just
illusions
we
obviouslu
taking
very
different
viewpoints
i
try
ponder
problem
consciousness
from
evolutionary
perspective
realising
might
anything
special
certainly
useful
thinking
back
what
i
wrote
do
you
think
worms
have
minds
able
experience
pain
least
behave
just
like
yet
conceivable
we
might
some
day
future
perform
total
synthesis
c
elegans
from
elements
would
worm
have
mind
firstly
i
m
impressed
ability
algorithms
re
great
solving
problems
once
method
has
been
worked
out
working
out
method
itself
true
some
extent
however
i
do
think
our
brains
work
like
computers
all
fact
substantial
evidence
skarda
skarda
freeman
brains
work
more
less
chaotically
generating
enough
randomness
mental
states
evolve
our
brains
work
much
like
genetic
algorithm
generators
i
suppose
trick
still
has
some
form
discovered
does
mean
all
ideas
we
ever
have
already
pre
programmed
our
brains
somewhat
unlikely
given
our
brains
ultimately
encoded
chromosomes
worth
genetic
material
much
which
isn
used
indeed
extremely
unlikely
given
vast
impact
nurture
our
mind
brain
i
suggest
however
before
trying
understand
our
consciousness
collection
algorithms
kevin
take
look
references
i
mentioned
think
again
i
still
think
best
experts
nature
conscious
mind
neurologists
neuropsychologists
biologists
do
flame
me
my
opinions
since
study
beings
conscious
reason
i
am
repeating
my
advice
discussion
cannot
lead
anywhere
our
backgrounds
too
different
please
do
bring
qm
discussion
all
all
physicists
happy
claim
our
consciousness
plays
some
special
role
physics
i
would
say
doesn
other
problem
algorithms
instability
many
algorithms
survive
you
take
out
large
portion
code
yet
people
survive
strokes
without
going
completely
haywire
side
effects
patients
still
seem
remarkably
stable
also
neurons
perfectly
healthy
people
dying
alarming
rate
can

survive

corrupt

what

replace

you
still

have

so
you
might
interested
again
please
note
subjective
experiences
cannot
observed
from

we
see
nothing
neuronal

we
cannot

kalat
writes
about
numerous
examples
where
electric
stimulation
different
areas
brain
have
led
various
changes
patients
state

instance
patient
whose
septal
area
stimulated
without
his
knowledge
remote
control
during
psychiatric
interview
quickly
cured
his
depression
started
discussing
plan
seduce
his
girlfriend
stimulations

have
sometimes
led
embarrassing
situations
when

have

conclusion
evidence
brains
essentially
necessary
subjective
experiences
brain
damage
usually
equivalent
some
sort
mind
damage
conscious
processes
involve
substantial
brain
activity
various
areas
brain
when
we
think
colours
our
visual
cortex
activated
etc
consciousness
afterthought
we
become
conscious
our
actions
half
second
delay
our
brains
ahead
our
conscious
least
ms
thus
i
think
fruitful
turn
question
why
do
i
see
colours
around
ask
what
i
seems
observing
since
seems
our
conscious
mind
king
our
brains
so
computer
won
see
colour
because
chemistry
different
does
algorithm
sees
colour
have
selective
advantage
over
equivalent
doesn
shouldn
because
outputs
each
algorithm
ought
same
equivalent
circumstances
so
why
do
we
see
colour
depends
what
meant
seeing
colours
does
neural
network
capable
recognising
handwritten
numbers
from
see
numbers
capable
sorting
them
you
asking
why
does
animal
who
conscious
itself
observer
have
evolutionary
advantage
over
animal
who
doesn
i
have
good
answer
read
my
previous
posting
where
i
wrote
why
sense
identity
helps
social
animals
swap
roles
act
more
morally
so
don
unconsciously
kill
each
other
newly
discovered
weapons
bit
extreme
basic
idea
when
early
homo
became
more
more

i
remember
correctly
quantum
mechanics
consists
wavefunction
two
processes

first
process
has
been
called
unitary
evolution
u
governed
schroedinger
equation
well
known
second
process
called
various
things
collapse
wavefunction
state
vector
reduction
r
more
mysterious
usually
said
occur
when
measurement
takes
place
although
nobody
seems
know
precisely
when
occurs
when
does
occur
effect
r
abruptly
change
wavefunction
minds
required
does
mean
until
human
minds
came
scene
wavefunctions
never
collapsed
remained
superpositions
aeons
my
how
powerful
we
has
been
discussed
before
i
think
topic
irrelevant
since
we
do
agree
minds
necessary
neither
do
physicists
anyway
i
m
speculating
minds
would
part
x
seems
some
link
between
consciousness
r
we
never
see
linear
superpositions
anything
although
alternative
explainations
i
ve
idea
how
brain
supposed
access
part
x
since
only
speculation
won
matter
too
much
my
main
point
might
place
minds
physics
i
agree
sense
you
apparently
mean
above
physics
needs
sharp
minds
solve
many
real
problems
i
ll
go
back

nice
padded

now
ok
