concise

logic
allows
us
analyze
piece
reasoning
determine
whether
correct
valid
invalid
course
one
does
need
study
logic
order
reason
correctly
nevertheless
little
basic
knowledge
logic
often
helpful
when
constructing
analyzing
argument
note
claim
being
made
here
about
whether
logic
universally
applicable
matter
very
much
open
debate
document
merely
explains
how
use
logic
given
you
have
already
decided
logic
right
tool
job
propositions
statements
building
blocks
logical
argument
proposition
statement
which
either
true
false
example
raining
today
tuesday
propositions
may
either
asserted
said
true
denied
said
false
note
technical
meaning

everyday
meaning
proposition
meaning
statement
particular
arrangement
words
used
express

argument
consists
three
stages
first
all
propositions
which
necessary

continue
stated
called

argument
evidence
reasons
accepting
argument
its
conclusions
premises
assertions
often
indicated

so

obviously
often
viewed
suspicion
can
used
intimidate
others
accepting
suspicious
premises
something
doesn
seem
obvious
you
don
afraid
question
you
can
always
say
oh
yes
you

all

involve

premise
implies

therefore

can
only

isolation
sometimes
argument
follow
order
given
above
example
conclusions
might
stated
first
premises
stated
afterwards
support
conclusion
perfectly
valid
sometimes
little
confusing
recognizing
argument
much
harder
than
recognizing
premises
conclusions
many
people
shower
writing
assertions
without
ever
producing
anything
which
one
might
reasonably
describe
argument
some
statements
look
like
arguments
example
bible
accurate
jesus
must
either
have
been
insane
evil
liar
son
god
argument
conditional
statement
does
assert
premises
which
necessary
support
what
appears
its
conclusion
also
suffers
from
number
other
logical
flaws
we
ll
come
those
later
another
example
god
created
you
therefore
do
your
duty
god
phrase
do
your
duty
god
proposition
since
neither

nor

must

argument
my
car
start
because
something
wrong
engine
explanation
two
traditional
types
argument
deductive
inductive
deductive
argument
one
which
provides
conclusive
proof
its
conclusions
argument
where
premises
true
conclusion
must
also
true
deductive
argument
either
valid
invalid
valid
argument
defined
one
where
premises
true
conclusion
true
inductive
argument
one
where
premises
provide
some
evidence
truth
conclusion
inductive
arguments
valid
invalid
however
we
can
talk
about
whether
better
worse
than
other
arguments
about
how
probable
premises
forms
argument
ordinary
language
which
neither
deductive
nor
inductive
however
we
concentrate
moment
deductive
arguments
often
viewed
most
rigorous
convincing
important
note
fact
deductive
argument
valid
does
imply
its
conclusion
holds
because
slightly
counter
intuitive
nature
implication
which
we
must
now
consider
more
carefully
obviously
valid
argument
can
consist
true
propositions
however
argument
may
entirely
valid
even
contains
only
false
propositions
example
all
insects
have
wings
premise
woodlice
insects
premise
therefore
woodlice
have
wings
conclusion
here
conclusion
true
because
argument
premises
false
argument
premises
were
true
however
conclusion
would
true
argument
thus
entirely
valid
more
subtly
we
can
reach
true
conclusion
from
one
more
false
premises
all
fish
live
sea
premise
dolphins
fish
premise
therefore
dolphins
live
sea
conclusion
however
one
thing
we
cannot
do
reach
false
conclusion
through
valid
inference
from
true
premises
we
can
therefore
draw
up
truth
table
implication

logical
arguments
would
require
lengthy
discussion

simpler
probably
more
useful
summarize
major
pitfalls
avoided
when
constructing

pitfalls
known
fallacies
everyday
english
term
fallacy
used
refer
mistaken
beliefs
well
faulty
reasoning
leads
those
beliefs
fair
enough
logic
term
generally
used
refer
form
technically
incorrect
argument
especially
argument
appears
valid
convincing
so
purposes
discussion
we
define
fallacy
logical
argument
which
appears
correct
which
can
seen
incorrect
when
examined
more
closely
studying
fallacies
we
aim
avoid
being
misled
them
following
list
fallacies
intended
exhaustive
argumentum
ad
baculum
appeal
force
appeal
force
committed
when
arguer
resorts
force
threat
force
order
try
push
acceptance
conclusion
often
used
politicians
can
summarized
might
makes
right
force
threatened
need
direct
threat
from
arguer
example
thus
ample
proof

all
those
who
refuse
accept

burn
hell
argumentum
ad
hominem
argumentum
ad
hominem
literally
argument
directed
man
abusive
variety
argumentum
ad
hominem
occurs
when
instead
trying
disprove
truth
assertion
arguer
attacks
person
people
making
assertion
invalid
because
truth
assertion
does
depend
upon
goodness
those
asserting
example
atheism
evil
philosophy
practised
communists
murderers
sometimes
court
law
doubt
cast
upon
testimony
witness
showing
example
he
known
perjurer
valid
way
reducing
credibility
testimony
given
witness
argumentum
ad
hominem
however
does
demonstrate
witness
testimony
false
conclude
otherwise
fall
victim
argumentum
ad
ignorantiam
see
elsewhere
list
circumstantial
form
argumentum
ad
hominem
committed
when
person
argues
his
opponent
ought
accept
truth
assertion
because
opponent
particular
circumstances
example
perfectly
acceptable
kill
animals
food
how
can
you
argue
otherwise
when
you
re
quite
happy
wear
leather
shoes
abusive
charge
inconsistency
used
excuse
dismissing
opponent
argument
fallacy
can
also
used
means
rejecting
conclusion
example
course
you
would
argue
positive
discrimination
bad
thing
you
re
white
particular
form
argumentum
ad
hominem
when
one
alleges
one
adversary
rationalizing
conclusion
formed
from
selfish
interests
also
known
poisoning
well
argumentum
ad
ignorantium
argumentum
ad
ignorantium
means
argument
from
ignorance
fallacy
occurs
whenever
argued
something
must
true
simply
because
has
been
proved
false
equivalently
when
argued
something
must
false
because
has
been
proved
true
note
same
assuming
something
false
until
has
been
proved
true
basic
scientific
principle
examples
course
bible
true
nobody
can
prove
otherwise
course
telepathy
other
psychic
phenomena
do
exist
nobody
has
shown
any
proof
real
note
fallacy
does
apply
court
law
where
one
generally
assumed
innocent
until
proven
guilty
also
scientific
investigation
known
event
would
produce
certain
evidence
its
having
occurred
absence
evidence
can
validly
used
infer
event
did
occur
example
flood
described
bible
would
require
enormous
volume
water
present
earth
earth
does
have
tenth
much
water
even
we
count
which
frozen
ice
poles
therefore
flood
occurred
science
we
can
validly
assume
from
lack
evidence
something
has
occurred
we
cannot
conclude
certainty
has
occurred
however
argumentum
ad
misericordiam
appeal
pity
also
known
special
pleading
fallacy
committed
when
arguer
appeals
pity
sake
getting
conclusion
accepted
example
i
did
murder
my
mother
father
axe
please
don
find
me
guilty
i
m
suffering
enough
through
being
orphan
argumentum
ad
populum
known
appealing
gallery
appealing
people
commit
fallacy
attempt
win
acceptance
assertion
appealing
large
group
people
form
fallacy
often
characterized
emotive
language
example
pornography
must
banned
violence
against
women
bible
must
true
millions
people
know
you
trying
tell
them
all
mistaken
fools
argumentum
ad
numeram
fallacy
closely
related
argumentum
ad
populum
consists
asserting
more
people
who
support
believe
proposition
more
likely
proposition
correct
argumentum
ad
verecundiam
appeal
authority
uses
admiration
famous
try
win
support
assertion
example
isaac
newton
genius
he
believed
god
line
argument
always
completely
bogus
example
reference
admitted
authority
particular
field
may
relevant
discussion
subject
example
we
can
distinguish
quite
clearly
between
stephen
hawking
has
concluded
black
holes
give
off
radiation
john
searle
has
concluded
impossible
build
intelligent
computer
hawking
physicist
so
we
can
reasonably
expect
his
opinions
black
hole
radiation
informed
searle
linguist
so
questionable
whether
he
well
qualified
speak
subject
machine
intelligence
fallacy
accident
fallacy
accident
committed
when
general
rule
applied
particular
case
whose
accidental
circumstances
mean
rule
inapplicable
error
made
when
one
goes
from
general
specific
example
christians
generally
dislike
atheists
you
christian
so
you
must
dislike
atheists
fallacy
often
committed
moralists
legalists
who
try
decide
every
moral
legal
question
mechanically
applying
general
rules
converse
accident
hasty
generalization
fallacy
reverse
fallacy
accident
occurs
when
one
forms
general
rule
examining
only
few
specific
cases
which
representative
all
possible
cases
example
jim
bakker
insincere
christian
therefore
all
christians
insincere
sweeping
generalization
dicto
simpliciter
sweeping
generalization
occurs
when
general
rule
applied
particular
situation
which
features
particular
situation
render
rule
inapplicable
sweeping
generalization
opposite
hasty
generalization
non
causa
pro
causa
post
hoc
ergo
propter
hoc
known
false
cause
fallacies
fallacy
non
causa
pro
causa
occurs
when
one
identifies
something
cause
event
has
actually
been
shown
cause
example
i
took
aspirin
prayed
god
my
headache
disappeared
so
god
cured
me
headache
fallacy
post
hoc
ergo
propter
hoc
occurs
when
something
assumed
cause
event
merely
because
happened
before
event
example
soviet
union
collapsed
after
taking
up
atheism
therefore
we
must
avoid
atheism
same
reasons
cum
hoc
ergo
propter
hoc
fallacy
similar
post
hoc
ergo
propter
hoc
asserts
because
two
events
occur
together
must
causally
related
leaves
room
other
factors
may
cause
events
petitio
principii
fallacy
occurs
when
premises
least
questionable
conclusion
reached
circulus
demonstrando
fallacy
occurs
when
one
assumes
premise
conclusion
which
one
wishes
reach
often
proposition
rephrased
so
fallacy
appears
valid
argument
example
homosexuals
must
allowed
hold
government
office
hence
any
government
official
who
revealed
homosexual
lose
his
job
therefore
homosexuals
do
anything
hide
secret
open
blackmail
therefore
homosexuals
cannot
allowed
hold
government
office
note
argument
entirely
circular
premise
same
conclusion
argument
like
above
has
actually
been
cited
reason
british
secret
services
official
ban
homosexual
employees
another
example
classic
we
know
god
exists
because
bible
tells
us
so
we
know
bible
true
because
word
god
complex
question
fallacy
interrogation
fallacy
presupposition
one
example
classic
loaded
question
have
you
stopped
beating
your
wife
question
presupposes
definite
answer
another
question
which
has
even
been
asked
trick
often
used
lawyers
cross
examination
when
ask
questions
like
where
did
you
hide
money
you
stole
similarly
politicians
often
ask
loaded
questions
how
long
ec
interference
our
affairs
allowed
continue
does
chancellor
plan
two
more
years
ruinous
privatization
ignoratio
elenchi
fallacy
irrelevant
conclusion
consists
claiming
argument
supports
particular
conclusion
when
actually
logically
nothing
do
conclusion
example
christian
may
begin
saying
he
argue
teachings
christianity
undoubtably
true
he
argues
length
christianity
great
help
many
people
matter
how
well
he
argues
he
have
shown
christian
teachings
true
sadly
fallacious
arguments
often
successful
because
arouse
emotions
which
cause
others
view
supposed
conclusion
more
favourable
light
equivocation
equivocation
occurs
when
key
word
used
two
more
different
meanings
same
argument
example
what
could
more
affordable
than
free
software
make
sure
remains
free
users
can
do
what
like
we
must
place
license
make
sure
always
freely
redistributable
amphiboly
amphiboly
occurs
when
premises
used
argument
ambiguous
because
careless
ungrammatical
phrasing
accent
accent
another
form
fallacy
through
shifting
meaning
case
meaning
changed
altering
which
parts
statement
emphasized
example
consider
we
should
speak
ill
our
friends
we
should
speak
ill
our
friends
fallacies
composition
one
fallacy
composition
conclude
property
shared
parts
something
must
apply
whole
example
bicycle
made
entirely
low
mass
components
therefore
very
lightweight
other
fallacy
composition
conclude
property
number
individual
items
shared
collection
those
items
example
car
uses
less
petrol
causes
less
pollution
than
bus
therefore
cars
less
environmentally
damaging
than
buses
fallacy
division
fallacy
division
opposite
fallacy
composition
like
its
opposite
exists
two
varieties
first
assume
property
some
thing
must
apply
its
parts
example
you
studying
rich
college
therefore
you
must
rich
other
assume
property
collection
items
shared
each
item
example
ants
can
destroy
tree
therefore
ant
can
destroy
tree
slippery
slope
argument
argument
states
should
one
event
occur
so
other
harmful
events
proof
made
harmful
events
caused
first
event
example
we
legalize
marijuana
we
would
have
legalize
crack
heroin
we
ll
have
nation
full
drug
addicts
welfare
therefore
we
cannot
legalize

best
explained
using
real
example
from
debate
about
anti
cryptography
legislation
i
believe
always
