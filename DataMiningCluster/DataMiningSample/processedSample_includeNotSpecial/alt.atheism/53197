types
being
pampered
looked
out
worst
all
respected
more
than
atheists
must
end
sight
i
think
d
help
we
got
couple
good
atheists
even
some
good
steadfast
agnostics
some
high
political
offices
when
last
time
we
had
openly
atheist
president
have
we
ever
i
don
actually
know
aren
rhetorical
questions
how
bout
some
supreme
court
justices
one
thing
really
ticked
me
off
while
ago
ad
news
program
local
station
promo
said
something
like
who
cults
why
do
prey
young
ahem
ever
hear
baptism
birth
isn
preying
young
i
don
know
what
i
used

even
confirmed
shortly
thereafter
i
decided
load
bs
my
mom
who
really
insisted
i
continue
go
church
felt
her
duty
bring
me
up
believer
one
more
presumptuous
things
i
ve
heard
my
life
i
suggested
we
go
talk
priest
she
agreed
priest
amazingly
cool
about
he
basically
said
i
didn
believe
good
forcing
me
actually
i
guess
he
wasn
amazingly
cool
about
his
response
what
you
d
hope
indeed
expect
from
human
being
i
pose
i
just
didn
expect
i
find
absurd
religion
exists
yet
i
can
also
see
its
usefulness
people
facing
up
fact
you
re
just
going
worm

some
cosmic

pretty
difficult
some
people
having
readily
available
pre

pretty
attractive
you
re
either
gullible
enough
b
willing
suspend
your
reasoning
abilities
piece

c
have
had
stuff
rammed
down
your
throat
long
you
can
remember
religion
general
provides
nice
patch
some
human
weaknesses
organized
religion
provides
nice
way
