first
i
ll
make
assumption
you
agree
murderer
one
who
has
commited
murder
well
i
d
say
murderer
one
who
intentionally
committed
murder
instance
you
put
bullet
gun
thought
contain
blanks
someone
killed
gun
person
who
actually
performed
action
isn
murderer
i
guess
actually
made
clear
below
definition
i
d
interested
see
more
reasonable
definition
what
do
you
mean
reasonable
otherwise
your
inductive
definition
doesn
bottom
out
your
definition
essence
murder
intentional
killing
someone
who
has
commited
murder
against
his
expanding
second
occurence
murder
above
we
see
yes
bad
include
word
being
defined
definition
even
though
series
recursively
infinite
i
think
meaning
can
still
deduced
i
assume
you
can
see
problem
here
do
correct
inductive
definition
you
must
define
something
terms
simpler
case
you
must
have
one
several
bottoming
out
cases
instance
we
can
define
factorial
function
function
which
assigns
positive
integer
product
positive
integers
less
than
equal
positive
integers
inductively
follows
math
lesson
deleted
okay
let
look
situation
suppose
longstanding
feud
between
two
families
which
claim
other
committed
some
travesty
distant
past
each
time
member
one
family
kills
member
other
other
family
thinks
justified
killing
member
first
family
now
let
suppose
sequence
has
occurred
infinite
number
times
you
don
like
dealing
infinities
suppose
one
member
family
goes
back
time
essentially
begins
whole
thing
never
ending
loop
slayings
based
some
non
existent
travesty
how
do
you
resolve
well
all
murders
now
i
suppose
isn
totally
applicable
your
problem
still
possible
reduce
uninduced
system
any
case
nested
murderer
definition
murder
cannot
infintely
recursive
given
finite
existence
humanity
murder
cannot
committed
without
killing
involved
so
first
person
intentionally
cause
someone
get
killed
necessarily
murderer
enough
induction
solve
apparently
unreducable
definition
see
totally
objective
system
where
all
information
available
nested
definition
isn
really
