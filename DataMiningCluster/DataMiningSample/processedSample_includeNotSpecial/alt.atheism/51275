charley
you
re
talking
about
intellectual
engagement
revelation
well
obviously
risk
one
takes
ah
now
here
core
question
let
me
suggest
scenario
we
grant
god
exists
uses
revelation
communicate
humans
said
revelation
taking
form
paraphrased
from
your
own
words
infinitely
powerful
deity
grabs
some
poor
schmuck
makes
him
take
dictation
hides
away
few
hundred
years
now
exists
human
who
has
personally
experienced
revelation
person
observes
only
do
revelations
seem
contain
elements
contradict
rather
strongly
aspects
observed
world
which
all
person
has
ever
seen
many
mutually
contradictory
claims
revelation
now
based
can
person
blamed
concluding
absent
personal
revelation
own
almost
certainly
nothing
revelation
thing
i
m
objectivist
so
i
m
particularly
impressed
problems
conceptualization
problem
case
least
bad
trying
explain
quantum
mechanics
relativity
terms
ordinary
experience
one
can
get
some
rough
understanding
language
from
perspective
ordinary
phenomena
inconsistent
from
perspective
what
being
described
rather
inexact
charitable
analogous
situation
supposedly
obtains
metaphysics
problem
better
descriptive
language
available
absent
better
language
absent
observations
support
claims
revelation
can
one
blamed
doubting
whole
thing
here
what
i
am
driving
i
have
thought
long
time
about
i
have
come
honest
conclusion
deity
nothing
like
ones
proposed
any
religion
i
am
familiar
now
does
happen
say
christian
god
i
held
accountable
honest
mistake
