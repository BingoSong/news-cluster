why
do
babies
get
diseases
etc
what
god
did
create
life
according
protein
code
which
mutable
can
evolve
without
delving
deep
discussion
creationism
vs
evolutionism
here
main
problem
scenario
you
outline
reasonably
consistent
all
evidence
i
am
familiar
only
does
support
indicates
something
far
different
earth
latest
estimates
about
billion
years
old
has
had
life
about
billion
those
years
humans
have
only
been
around
most
about
years
fossil
evidence
inidcates
life
has
been
changing
evolving
fact
disease
ridden
long
before
were
people
yes
fossils
show
signs
disease
mostly
bone
disorders
course
some
heck
just
fossil
evidence
what
we
ve
been
able
glean
from
genetic
study
shows
disease
has
been
around
long
long
time
human
sin
what
brought
about
disease
least
indirectly
though
necessarily
how
could
exist
before
humans
god
created
original
genetic
code
perfect
without
flaw
without
getting
sidetracked
theological
ramifications
original
sin
main
effect
so
called
original
sin
discussion
remove
humanity
from
god
protection
since
choice
e
cut
themselves
off
from
intimate
fellowship
god
addition
sin
caused
them
come
under
dominion
satan
who
assumed
dominion
over
earth
deletions
since
humanity
longer
under
god
protection
under
satan
dominion
great
feat
satan
genetically
engineer
diseases
both
bacterial
viral
genetic
although
forces
natural
selection
tend
improve
survivability
species
degeneration
genetic
code
tends
more
than
offset
uh
i
know
many
evolutionary
biologists
who
know
more
about
biology
than
you
claim
who
strongly
disagree
evidence
human
genetic
code
any
other
started
off
perfect
condition
seems
adapt
its
envionment
collective
sense
i
m
really
curious
what
you
mean
degeneration
genetic
code
human
dna
being
more
complex
tends
accumulate
errors
adversely
affecting
our
well
being
ability
fight
off
disease
while
simpler
dna
bacteria
viruses
tend
become
more
efficient
causing
infection
disease
bad
combination
umm
nah
we
seem
do
pretty
good
job
adapting
viruses
bacteria
us
only
very
small
percentage
microlife
harmful
humans
small
percentage
seems
reasonalby
constant
size
ranks
keep
changing
example
bubonic
plague
used
really
nasty
disease
i
m
sure
you
ll
agree
still
pops
up
from
time
time
even
today
doesn
do
much
damage
part
because
better
sanitation
even
when
people
get
disease
symptoms
tend
less
severe
than
past
seems
partly
because
people
who
were
very
susceptible
died
off
long
ago
because
really
nasty
variants
overgrazed
forgive
poor
terminology
i
m
engineer
doctor
died
off
lack
nearby
hosts
i
could
wrong
from
what
i
gather
acne
only
few
hundred
years
old
used
nastier
though
killer
seems
getting
less
nasty
w
age
hence
we
have
newborns
suffer
from
genetic
viral
bacterial
diseases
disorders
now
wait
minute
i
have
question
humans
were
created
perfect
right
you
admit
we
have
inbuilt
abiliy
fight
off
disease
seems
unlikely
satan
who
making
diseases
would
also
gift
humans
means
fight
them
off
simpler
make
diseases
less
lethal
he
wants
survivors
far
i
can
see
our
immune
systems
imperfect
though
may
presently
must
have
been
built
us
god
i
want
clear
you
saying
god
planning
ahead
time
when
satan
would
charge
building
immune
system
time
design
necessary
god
made
our
immune
systems
ahead
time
knowing
adam
eve
would
sin
descendents
would
need
fight
off
diseases
may
more
mystical
supernatural
explanation
than
you
prepared
accept
god
responsible
disease
even
satan
had
nothing
do
original
inception
disease
evolution
random
chance
would
have
produced
them
since
humanity
forsook
god
protection
here
another
puzzle
what
exactly
do
you
mean
perfect
phrase
created
perfect
without
flaw
my
mind
perfect
system
would
incapable
degrading
over
time
perfect
system
without
constant
intervention
become
imperfect
perfect
system
least
imho
god
did
something
like
writing
masterpiece
novel
bunch
gum
wrappers
held
together
elmer
glue
original
genetic
instructions
were
perfect
were
written
inferior
materials
had
carefully
tended
would
fall
apart
so
why
could
god
have
used
better
materials
god
incapable
creating
system
could
maintain
itself
did
just
choose
deletions
summary
newborns
innocent
god
does
cause
suffering
my
main
point
i
said
really
isn
any
evidence
explanation
you
give
least
i
m
aware
i
couldn
help
making
few
nitpicks
here
