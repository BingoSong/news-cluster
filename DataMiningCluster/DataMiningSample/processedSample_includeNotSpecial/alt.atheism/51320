casually
trashed
two
thousand
years
jewish
history
ken
replied
had
previously
been
people
like
him
germany
i
think
problem
here
i
pretty
much
ignored
part
about
jews
sightseeing
years
thinking
instead
important
part
what
original
poster
said
bit
about
killing
palestinians
retrospect
i
can
see
how
sightseeing
thing
would
offensive
many
i
originally
saw
just
poetic
license
understandable
others
might
see
differently
i
still
think
ken
came
bit
strong
though
i
also
think
your
advice
masud
khan
before
you
argue
someone
like
mr
arromdee
good
idea
do
little
homework
least
think
unnecessary
right
have
been
have
also
been
people
who
were
formally
nazis
nazi
party
would
have
gone
nowhere
without
active
tacit
support
ordinary
man
street
who
behaved
though
casual
anti
semitism
perfectly
acceptable
now
what
exactly
don
you
understand
about
what
i
wrote
why
don
you
see
what
has
do
matter
hand
throughout
all
your
articles
thread
tacit
assumption
original
poster
exhibiting
casual
anti
semitism
i
agreed
maybe
your
speech
why
bad
might
have
been
relevant
i
think
you
re
reading
lot
one
flip
sentence
while
probably
true
case
too
often
charge
anti
semitism
gets
thrown
around
order
stifle
legitimate
criticism
state
israel
anyway
i
