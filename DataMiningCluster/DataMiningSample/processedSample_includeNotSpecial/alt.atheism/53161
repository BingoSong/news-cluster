how
many

do
you
want
see
good
question
i
claim
something
general

disprove
i
guess
you
d
have
show
general
trend
you
re
going
claim
something
up
you
prove
think
cold
fusion
well
i
ve
provided
examples
show
trend
general
you
others
have
provided
some
counterexamples
mostly
ones
surrounding
mating
practices
etc
i
don
think
few
cases
enough
disprove
general
trend
natural
morality
again
mating
practices
need
reexamined
try
find
immoral
non
mating
related
activities
so
you
re
excluding
mating
related
activities
from
your
natural
morality
mating
practices
special
case
i
ll
have
think
about
some
more
yes
i
think
natural
system
can
objectively
deduced
goal
species
propogation
mind
i
am
equating
two
you
so
think
objective
system
isn
necessarily
natural
one
you
you
man
who
wrote
natural
moral
system
objective
moral
system
most
animals
follow
indeed
while
natural
system
objective
all
objective
systems
natural
one
so
terms
can
equated
natural
system
subset
objective
ones
now
since
homosexuality
has
been
observed
most
animals
including
birds
dolphins
you
going
claim
most
animals
have
capacity
being
immoral
i
don
claim
homosexuality
immoral
isn
harmful
although
isn
helpful
either
mating
process
when
you
say
homosexuality
observed
animal
kingdom
don
you
mean
bisexuality
because
we
can
determine
what
end
we
should
moral
you
claiming
group
we
usually
implies
more
than
one
entity
standard
jargon
read
any
textbook
we
forms
used
throughout
well
i
m
saying
goals
inherent
why
must
postulates
because
really
way
determine
them
otherwise
although
could
argued
arise
from
natural
goal
somewhat
removed
postulate
assume
posit
right
goals
themselves
aren
inherent
i
can
create
theory
postulate
sun
revolves
around
earth
moon
actually
made
green
cheese
stars
portions
angels
intrudes
three
dimensional
reality
you
could
would
contradict
observations
i
can
build
mathematical
proof
postulate
given
length
one

length
second

triangle
degree
angle
connecting

i
can
determine
length
third

postulate
something
generally
always
found
true
i
don
think
your
postulate
would
valid
guess
which
one
people
going
more

assume
something
about
your

you
have
able

work
yes
i
