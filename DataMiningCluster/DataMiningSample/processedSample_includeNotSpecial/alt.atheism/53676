annoying
rushdie
saw

golden
opportunity
lash
out
organized
islam
he
did
so
admirable
verbal
skill
only
kind
islam
which
rushdie
finds
palatable
what
he
calls
secular
islam
islam
separated
from
qur
prophet
god
its

from
any
intrusion

perhaps
step

down
perhaps
you
even
feel
he
justified
boldly
defying
anger
all
those
who
dare
take

his

matter
what
insult
find
within
perhaps
you
see
him
kind
secular
heroic
knight
mounted
his

steed
doing
battle
dragon
islamic
fundamentalism
well
khomeini
saw
him
disingeneous
author
who
grew

who
wrote
book

mischievously
uses

rushdie
you
re
attempts

doing

islam
any
good
i
have
made
attempts
justification
only
explanation
image
chief
concern
muslim
apologists
islam
rushdie
muslims
willingly
relegated
themselves
becoming
sub
culture
within
larger
secular
culture
secular
principles
laws
had
precedence
over
laws
islam
i
have
doubt
islam
would
thought
have
good
image
principally
because
would
large
reflect
secular
image
good
image
usually
means
more
like
me
your
attempts
totally
exonerating
rushdie
reflect
exactly
attitude
resulted
polarization
brought
about
crisis
iran
situation
monitored
many
months
when
rushdie
kept
adding
fuel
flames
through
free
worldwide
voice
media
gave
him
situation
monitored
more
seriously
when
even
after
many
deaths
occured
worldwide
rushdie
still
did
desist
fatwa
pronounced
when
behaving
like
total
jerk
endangers
lives
jerk
sees
still
insists
his
right
behave
like
total
jerk
he
has
rug
jerked
out
from
under
him
muslims
didn
make
big
fuss
over
book
like
issuing
death
threats
killing
publishers
one
would
have
heard
fatwa
came
later
much
later
rushdie
didn
mouth
off
so
much
media
fuss
would
have
died
down
one
would
have
been
killed
fatwa
would
have
been
passed
whole
episode
would
have
fizzled
away
