i
think
you
confusing
words
objective
inherent
objective
system
simply
one
which
outside
observer
who
given
postulates
system
could
perfectly
judge
any
situation
action
consistent
system
right
wrong
you
seem
objecting
because
goals
system
inherent
you
seem
want
define
objective
system
one
which
postulates
themselves
could
determined
some
outside
observer
i
don
think
good
definition
objective
system
you
need
learn
english
really
gravity
objective
system
anybody
can
learn
what
perform
experiments
get
same
results
every
other
person
who
has
performed
those
experiments
gravity
inherent
system
you
don
need
any
excess
information
other
than
observations
determine
anything
possible
objectively
determine
someone
guilt
innocence
within
non
inherent
system
i
agree
morality
necessarily
inherent
unless
you
state
everything
we
do
has
evolutionary
basis
does
mean
cannot
objective
theory
natural
morality
objective
system
evidenced
your
comments
about
lions
mine
perhaps
can
objective
inherent
anyway
i
noted
before
practices
related
mating
rituals
etc
among
animals
likely
only
ones
considered
immoral
under
previous
definitions
natural
law
therefore
some
revisions
order
since
class
activities
surrounding
mating
seem
pose
some
general
problems
fact
only
way
postulates
could
determined
outsider
would
were
some
sort
higher
truth
like
some
sort
god
something
i
do
think
god
necessary
objective
system
while
seems
you
do
what
you
trying
say
here
seens
you
objecting
notion
objective
system
because
perhaps
you
think
would
imply
inherence
which
would
necessitate
some
sort
grand
design
i
have
classified
behavior
most
animals
line
moral
system
certainly
possible
animals
commit
acts
which
outside
rules
ethics
don
seem
do
so
very
often
perhaps
intelligent
enough
immoral
perhaps
because
you
have
yet
define
moral
system
i
think
i
have
code
ethics
which
basically
defines
undesired
behaviors
etc
immoral
behavior
could
unwanted
unproductive
destructive
etc
depending
goal
system
immoral
