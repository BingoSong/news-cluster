done
so
none
has
shown
more
knowledge

impart
all
have
made
factual
misstatements
about

book
you
keep
saying
things
like

who
have
repeated
propaganda
about
book
indicating
haven
read
narrowly
gregg
jaeger
who
subsequently
admitted
he
hadn
fact
read
book
vindicating
my
skepticism

one
case
so
far
only
things
i
have
go
regarding
your
own
