light
what
happened
waco
i
need
get
something
my
chest
sadly
understandable
faith
dogma
dangerous
yes
religion
inherently
encourages
implementation
faith
dogma
reason
i
scorn
religion
fair
you
should
really
qualify
semitic
western
religions
you
basically
go
ahead
do
later
anyway
i
have
expressed
notion
past
some
christians
debated
me
whether
christianity
leaves
any
room
reasoning
i
claimed
rationality
quelled
out
christianity
faith
dogma
again
should
really
evaluated
personal
level
example
only
one
jesus
presumably
he
probably
didn
say
all
many
things
yet
seemingly
billions
billions
christian
sects
have
arisen
perhaps
one
totally
dedicated
rationalism
believes
christ
pantheism
would
seem
go
against
bible
amazing
what
people
come
up
under
guise
personal
interpretation
philosopher
cannot
christian
because
philosopher
can
change
his
mind
whereas
christian
cannot
due
nature
faith
dogma
present
any
religion
good
point
we
have
here
quintessential
christian
he
sets
up
system
values
beliefs
himself
which
work
very
well
every
event
experience
understandable
deablable
within
framework
system
however
we
also
have
individual
who
has
inability
least
without
some
difficulty
change
which
important
because
problem
system
same
any
system
one
cannot
open
minded
point
testing
hypotheses
against
basic
premise
system
without
destroying
whatever
faith
invested
therein
unless
course
all
tests
fail
other
words
fairer
way
would
test
evaluate
moralities
without
bias
responsibility
losing
retaining
system
i
claimed
christian
philosopher
christian
person
whose
beliefs
moment
correspond
those
christianity
consider
person
visiting
guarding
prison
prisoner
unless
you
define
prisoner
simply
someone
prison
can
we
define
prisoner
someone
who
moment
prison
can
we
define
christian
someone
who
moment
has
christian
beliefs
because
person
free
go
he
prisoner
similarly
person
constrained
faith
dogma
he
christian
interesting
again
when
seems
basically
boil
down
individual
nuances
although
always
i
admit
probably
mass
oriented
divisions
which
most
appalling
becomes
irrelevant
unfortunately
i
admit
word
game
i
m
going
dictionary
definition
religion
religion
n
concern
over
what
exists
beyond
visible
world
differentiated
from
philosophy
operates
through
faith
intuition
rather
than
reason
webster
now
let
go
beyond
word
game
i
don
claim
religion
causes
genocide
i
think
all
humans
were
atheist
would
still
genocide
always
humans
who
don
think
always
humans
who
don
ask
themselves
what
real
difference
between
themselves
people
different
colored
skin
different
language
different
beliefs
granted
religion
like
gun
doesn
kill
anybody
religion
encourages
faith
dogma
although
doesn
directly
condemn
people
encourages
use
just
because
thinking
just
because
thinking
kills
people
which
case
people
become
bullets
religion
gun
merely
offers
them
way
more
adequately
do
some
harm
themselves
i
may
so
bold
extend
your
similie
sure
religion
has
many
good
qualities
encourages
benevolence
philanthropy
ok
so
take
out
only
bad
things
like
faith
dogma
tradition
put
good
things
like
careful
reasoning
science
result
secular
humanism
wouldn
nice
everyone
were
secular
humanist
please
supernaturalists
you
might
even
leave
god
secular
emphasis
would
cause
supernaturalists
start
thinking
too
would
realize
belief
god
really
doesn
put
anyone
further
ahead
understanding
universe
ok
i
m
just
poking
fun
supernaturalists
also
understandable
course
all
humans
capable
thought
we
d
still
have
genocide
maybe
even
some
mass
suicide
much
i
m
willing
bet
