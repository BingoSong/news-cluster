rushdie
however
i
understand
muslim
fact
he
british
citizen
does
preclude
his
being
muslim
rushdie
atheist
use
local
terminology
put
words
his
mouth
time
writing
tsv
time
fatwa
february
well
he
born
muslim
i
am
fairly
certain
he
he
muslim
until
he
explicitly
renounces
islam
so
far
i
know
he
has
never
explicitly
renounced
islam
though
he
may
have
been
extreme
doubt
about
existence
god
being
muslim
legal
well
intellectual
issue
according
islam
put
simply
possible
i
am
muslim
i
do
accept
charge
apostacy
because
i
have
never
my
adult
life
affirmed
any
belief
what
one
has
affirmed
one
can
said
have
apostasized
from
islam
i
know
states
clearly
can
coercion
matters
religion
many
muslims
i
respect
would
horrified
idea
belong
faith
purely
virtue
birth
person
who
freely
chose
muslim
could
therefore
put
death
salman
rushdie
good
faith
god
satan
paradise
hell
all
vanished
one
day
my
fifteenth
year
when
i
quite
abruptly
lost
my
faith
afterwards
prove
my
new
found
atheism
i
bought
myself
rather
tasteless
ham
sandwich
so
partook
first
time
forbidden
flesh
swine
thunderbolt
arrived
strike
me
down
from
day
i
have
thought
myself
wholly
seculat
person
salman
rushdie
god
we
trust
i
think
rushdie
affair
has
discredited
islam
more
my
eyes
than
khomeini
i
know
fanatics
fringe
elements
all
religions
even
apparently
moderate
muslims
have
participated
refused
distance
themselves
from
witch
hunt
against
rushdie
yes
i
think
true
khomenei
motivations
quite
irrelevant
issue
fact
matter
rushdie
made
false
statements
fiction
i
know
where
line
between
fact
fiction
about
life
mohammad
only
functional
illiterate
absolutely
conception
nature
novel
could
think
thing
i
ll
accept
reluctantly
from
mobs
pakistan
from
you
what
presented
fictional
dream
demented
character
cannot
wildest
stretch
imagination
considered
reflection
actual
mohammad
what
worse
novel
doesn
present
mahound
mohammed
character
any
worse
light
than
secular
histories
islam
particular
lewd
misrepresentation
his
life
his
wives
why
few
people
rush
his
defense
he
considered
absolute
fool
his
writings
satanic
verses
don
hold
back
he
considered
apostate
blasphemer
however
his
writing
satanic
verses
what
people
have
accepted
propagandistic
version
what
contained
book
i
have
yet
find
one
single
muslim
who
has
convinced
me
have
read
book
some
have
initially
claimed
have
done
so
none
has
shown
more
knowledge
book
than
superficial
newsweek
story
might
impart
all
have
made
factual
misstatements
about
events
book
you
wish
understand
reasons
behind
well
has
origin
concept
satanic
verses
see
penguin
paperback
rafiq
zakariyah
called
mohammad
quran
i
ll
keep
eye
out
i
have
counter
proposal
i
suggest
you
see
