didn
you
say
lucifer
created
perfect
nature
yes
define
perfect
i
think
you
playing
usual
game
here
make
sweeping
statements
like
omni
holy
perfect
don
note
mean
exactly
what
say
says
you
must
use
terms
when
leads
contradictions
i
m
trying
play
games
here
i
understand
how
might
seem
way
especially
when
one
coming
from
completely
different
point
view
atheism
take
your
foot
out
your
mouth
i
wondered
about
already
when

catholic
christian

unresolvable

reasons
why
i
am
atheist

me
i
believed
similar
sentences
long

shows
power
religion
anything
about
its
claims
now
god
could
have
prevented
lucifer
fall
taking
away
his

choose
between
moral

worship
god
worship
himself
would
mean

error
have
make
lucifer
any

exactly
god
allows
evil
evil
ever

now
opinion
best
premise
from
my
point
view
premise
which
necessary
true
specifically
evil
allow
evil
occur
follows
from
definition
evil
ordinarily
used
letting
evil
happen
allowing
evil
take
place
place
even
causing
evil
another
evil
could
you
give

omniscient
being
self
determination
other
words
god
created
conscious
beings
who
have

between

therefore
free

do

james

god
omniscient
clearly
creating
beings
free
moral

greater
good
than
emergence
ungodliness
evil
sin
since
he
created

knowing
outcome
advance
why
greater
good
allow

why
make
unipolar
system
possibility
doing
good
doing
good
does
necessarily
imply
doing
evil
logically
possible
your
god
has
done
i
do
know
logically
possible
god
restrains
free
being
choice
choose
do
evil
simply
do
good
can
said
being
truly
has
free
moral
choice
good
defined
loving
obeying
god
avoiding
those
behaviors
which
god
prohibits
how
can
you
say
one
who
good
evil
well
like
i
said
i
am
sure
doing
good
without
doing
evil
logically
possible
when
i
am
omnipotent
how
can
i
have
free
you
have
said
something
about
choices
scenario
gives
them
therefore
we
have
what
you
define
free
imagine
following
i
can
do
good
other
beings
i
cannot
harm
them
easily
implemented
making
everyone
appreciate
being
object
good
deeds
don
make
them
long
them
so
can
feel
absence
good
evil
whose
case
am
i
arguing
conceivable
so
omnipotent
can
do
would
omnipotent
you
want
logically
consistent
well
you
have
give
up
pet
idea
omnipotent
first
deletion
perhaps
weak
way
i
were
just
speculating
about
ubiquitous
pink
unicorns
would
basis
speculation
idea
god
didn
just
fall
me
out
blue
while
reading
science
fiction
fantasy
i
know
some
disagree
bible
describes
god
who
omniscient
nevertheless
created
beings
free
moral
choice
from
which
definitional
logic
follows
all
seems
least
my
mind
certain
amount
evidence
which
indicates
god
exists
biblical
description
him
may
fair
one
evidence
which
bolsters
argument
my
view
bible
describes
omniscient
omnipotent
god
destroys
credibility
bible
nothing
less
lot
people
would
interested
evidence
god
unfortunately
can
any
definitions
