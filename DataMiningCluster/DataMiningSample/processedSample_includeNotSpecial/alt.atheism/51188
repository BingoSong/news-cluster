someone
writes
i
found
list
biblical
contradictions
cleaned
up
bit
now
i
d
like
some
help
i
m
curious
know
what
purpose
people
think
lists
serve
about
time
why
do
atheists
spend
so
much
time
paying
attention
bible
anyway
face
better
things
do
your
life
i
used
chuckle
snort
over
silliness
book
absurdity
people
believing
truth
etc
why
do
we
spend
so
little
time
mayan
religion
native
americans
heck
native
americans
have
signifigantly
more
interesting
myths
also
what
about
egyptians
i
think
we
pay
so
much
attention
christianity
because
we
accept
religion
mythology
which
i
find
more
accurate
i
try
tolerant
gets
very
hard
when
someone
places
book
under
my
nose
tells
me
special
