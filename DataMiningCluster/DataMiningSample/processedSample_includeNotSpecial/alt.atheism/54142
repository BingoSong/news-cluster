pardon
me
i
am
trying
apply
human
terms
non
humans
right
you
basically
stating
morality
can
only
deal
humans
because
only
humans
sentient
enough
moral
you
say
morality
can
only
deal
intentions
i
have
never
said
only
humans
only
beings
which
sufficiently
sentient
have
intentions
fact
i
have
explicitly
said
i
am
perfectly
happy
consider
some
animals
capable
forming
intentions
what
i
am
objecting
considering
programmed
instinctive
behaviour
have
moral
significance
since
seems
me
behaviour
does
involve
intention
i
think
even
someone
conscious
alternative
does
prevent
his
behavior
from
being
moral
i
m
sure
you
do
think
you
say
so
how
about
trying
convince
me
i
think
moral
act
moral
whether
implementor
thinks
point
point
whether
implementor
thinks
all
issue
whether
thinking
produces
opinion
opinion
b
whether
thinking
takes
place
period
i
ve
offered
four
times
i
think
accept
your
definition
you
allow
me
ascribe
moral
significence
orbital
motion
planets
hmm
perhaps
you
can
ascribe
i
could
say
many
human
actions
natural
thus
don
follow
natural
morality
since
humans
part
nature
all
human
actions
natural
perhaps
you
re
going
throw
definition
natural
allow
us
describe
some
actions
natural
some
natural
so
what
definition
other
than
those
death
which
surround
mating
rituals
other
animals
just
don
kill
each
other
within
species
often
do
sure
do
multiple
posters
have
show
you
sharks
example
eat
wounded
sharks
i
ve
personally
seen
cats
eat
newborn
you
some
kind
denial
people
give
you
example
after
example
you
go
off
air
week
pop
up
claiming
never
happened
very
strange
why
don
animals
kill
each
other
see
what
i
mean
here
we
go
again
what
do
we
have
do
write
up
tailor
made
faq
