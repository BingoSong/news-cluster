when

though
subject

bible
says
response
most
readers
alt
atheism
feel
bible
questionable
accuracy
written
thousands
years
ago
many
authors
who
were
recording
oral
tradition
existed
many
years
before
thus
any
claimed
truth
questionable
legitimacy
isn
say
bible
has
truth
simply
any
truth
must
examined
before
being
accepted
many

group
also
feel
because
any
passage
subject
interpretation
any
claim
passage
means
one
thing
one

only
legitimate
note
feeling

many

therefore
foolish
atheist
response
argument
known
pascal
wager
has
several
flaws
firstly
does
indicate
which
religion
follow
indeed
many
mutually
exclusive
contradictory
religions
out
often
described
avoiding
wrong
hell

he
may
end
up

y
version
hell
secondly
statement
you
believe

turn
out
incorrect
you
have
lost
nothing
true
suppose
you
re
believing
wrong
god
true
god
might
punish
you
your
foolishness
consider
also
deaths
have
resulted
from
people
rejecting
medicine
favour
prayer
another
flaw
argument
based
assumption
two
possibilities
equally
likely
least
comparable
likelihood
fact
possibility
being
god
close
zero
argument
becomes
much
less
persuasive
so
sadly
argument
only
likely
convince
those
who
believe
already
also
many
feel
intellectually
honest
people
belief
based
evidence
some
amount
intuition
matter
cost
benefit
analysis
formally
speaking
argument
consists
four
statements
one
does
know
whether
god
exists
believing
god
bad
one
eternal
soul
god
does
exist
believing
god
consequence
god
does
exist
therefore
one
interest
believe
god
two
approaches
argument
first
view
assumption
consequence
one
problem
approach
abstract
creates
information
from
information
considered
invalid
information
theory
statement
indicates
one
has
information
about
god
statement
indicates
beneficial
information
can
gained
from
absolute
lack
information
about
god
violates
information
entropy
information
has
been
extracted
from
information
cost
alternative
approach
claim
both
assumptions
problem
basically
assumption
which
states
christian
position
only
christian
agree
assumption
argument
thus
collapses
you
christian
your
interests
believe

rather
vacuous
tautology

pascal

viewed
biggest
reason
why
pascal

failure

unfortunately
some

simple

assume

one

yet
like

universe

so
argument
goes
universe
too
must
have
creator
watchmaker
analogy
suffers
from
three
particular
flaws
over
above
those
common
all
arguments
design
firstly
watchmaker
creates
watches
from
pre
existing
materials
whereas
god
claimed
have
created
universe
from
nothing
two
sorts
creation
clearly
fundamentally
different
analogy
therefore
rather
weak
secondly
watchmaker
makes
watches
many
other
things
world
we
walked
further
along
beach
found
nuclear
reactor
we
wouldn
assume
created
watchmaker
argument
would
therefore
suggest
multitude
creators
each
responsible
different
part
creation
finally
first
part
watchmaker
argument
we
conclude
watch
part
nature
because
ordered
therefore
stands
out
from
randomness
nature
yet
second
part
argument
we
start
from
position
