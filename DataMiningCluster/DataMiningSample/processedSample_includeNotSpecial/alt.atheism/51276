get
point
therefore
nutshell
my
opinion
pre
marital
sex
makes
likelihood
extra
marital
sex
more
probable
furthermore
my
opinion
extra
marital
sex
helps
break
down
partnerships
leads
greater
divorce
rates
turn
my
opinion
creates
trauma
less
stable
environment
children
who
my
opinion
more
likely
grow
up
psychological
problems
depression
etc
thus
sex
outside
marriage
long
run
harmful
society
i
think
you
drawing
links
where
none
having
sex
before
marriage
has
nothing
do
adultery
once
committed
marriage
issue
i
see
more
how
committed
you
foisting
pain
your
spouse
how
confident
you
about
yourself
addition
what
someone
does
within
marriage
own
business
mine
yours
i
have
witnessed
strong
relationships
incorporate
extra
marital
sex
i
would
agree
your
assertion
about
children
children
should
witness
confusing
relationships
adultery
stressful
adults
which
i
assume
general
how
can
we
expect
children
understand
where
evidence
my
opinions
moment
just
generalities
i
can
cite
example
i
read
th
century
percentage
youth
people
general
who
suffer
from
depression
has
been
steadily
climbing
western
societies
probably
what
i
reading
referred
particularly
usa
similarly
one
can
detect
trend
towards
greater
occurrence
sex
outside
marriage
century
western
societies
particularly
sexual
revolution
even
before
i
think
otherwise
sexual
revolution
would
have
been
possible
particularly
gradual
weakening
christianity
consequently
christian
moral
teachings
against
sex
outside
marriage
i
propose
two
trends
greater
level
general
depression
society
other
psychological
problems
greater
sexual
promiscuity
linked
latter
being
prime
cause
former
i
cannot
provide
any
evidence
beyond
stage
whole
thesis
seems
very
reasonable
me
i
request
people
ponder
upon
why
more
reasonable
than
trend
towards
obesity
trend
towards
depression
you
can
just
pick
your
two
favorite
trends
notice
correlation
them
make
sweeping
statement
generality
i
mean
you
can
people
have
does
mean
valid
reasonable
thesis
best
gross
oversimplification
push
pull
factors
people
experience
my
argument
mainly
proposal
what
i
think
plausible
argument
against
extra
marital
sex
one
which
i
personally
believe
has
some
truth
my
main
purpose
posting
here
show
plausible
argument
can
made
against
extra
marital
sex
stage
i
am
saying
particular
viewpoint
proven
anything
like
just
plausible
try
convince
you
all
particular
point
view
i
would
probably
have
do
lot
work
researching
what
has
been
done
field
etc
order
gather
further
evidence
which
i
simply
do
have
time
do
now
also
note
i
said
i
think
extra
marital
sex
prime
cause
my
opinion
generally
greater
levels
psychological
problems
especially
depression
western
societies
i
am
saying
prime
cause
only
cause
just
prime
cause
i
e
one
significant
contributions
trend
i
think
when
you
say
you
think
my
view
simplistic
you
have
forgotten
i
admit
probably
other
factors
i
do
think
extra
marital
sex
imo
subsequent
destabilization
family
significant
factor
rise
psychological
problems
like
depression
western
society
