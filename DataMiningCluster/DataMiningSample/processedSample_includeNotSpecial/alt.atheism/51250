deletion
gregg
you
cannot
say
lenient
punishes
severely
public
unless
course
one
exceptions
implied
almost
all
matters
depends
statistics
who
punished
public
some
power
example
nothing
islamic
about
allows
men
rape
women
five
times
before
blowing
rapist
head
off
public
i
d
call
leniency
wouldn
you
you
have
given
example
lenient
end
argument
chopping
off
hands
heads
people
lenient
either
rather
appears
you
internalized
claims
about
legal
system
without
checking
suit
description
wasn
argument
takes
five
men
rape
woman
according
islamic
law
while
i
don
approve
i
think
both
prostitute
customer
have
right
do
what
do
other
words
punishing
them
violation
rights
punish
them
severely
public
just
another
pointer
hysteria
connected
sexuality
so
many
religions
believe
what
you
like
i
even
believe
what
i
don
like
can
you
give
better
answers
than
have
you
got
any
evidence
your
probably
opposite
claims
case
i
don
see
why
i
should
accept
complex
ridden
views
oriental
goatherd
ah
yes
i
forget
west
historically
so
much
without
sexual
neurosis
oriental
goatherd
really
intellectual
fact
memory
serves
most
see
connection
between
primitive
machism
orient
islam
people
agree
having
sex
fine
i
would
assume
god
would
have
clue
what
detrimental
effects
supressing
huh
ever
heard
aids
course
you
ll
probably
go
say
god
must
evil
because
he
allows
disease
exist
bla
bla
usually
you
miss
point
aids
neither
spread
only
through
sex
nor
necessarily
spread
having
sex
futher
point
very
important
point
urge
sex
stronger
than
fear
aids
even
stronger
than
religious
attempts
channel
forbid
sex
consequences
suppressing
sex
worse
than
consequences
aids
please
note
idea
everybody
would
end
up
aids
when
sex
controlled
completely
counterfactual
since
you
have
brought
up
point
your
god
evil
