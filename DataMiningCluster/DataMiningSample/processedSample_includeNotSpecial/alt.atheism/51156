good
deal
more
confusion
here
you
started
off
assertion
some
objective
morality
you
admit
here
you
finished
up
recursive
definition
murder
objectively
immoral
eactly
what
murder
what
itself
requires
appeal
morality
i
think
you
mean
circular
recursive
semantics
recursiveness
has
problems
just
horribly
inefficient
just
ask
any
assembly
programmer
yes
now
you
have
switch
targets
little
only
little
now
you
asking
what
goal
what
do
you
mean
goal
you
suggesting
some
objective
goal
out
somewhere
we
form
our
morals
achieve
well
example
goal
natural
morality
survival
propogation
species
another
example
moral
system
presented
within
declaration
independence
which
states
we
should
guaranteed
life
liberty
pursuit
happiness
you
see
have
moral
system
we
must
define
purpose
system
we
shall
moral
unto
what
end
oft
quoted
line
says
people
should
guaranteed
life
liberty
pursuit
happiness
inalienable
rights
complete
lie
deception
very
authors
line
were
process
proving
liberty
never
free
always
purchased
some
cost
almost
always
cost
another
whos
liberty
more
inalienable
similarly
right
life
when
one
person
must
die
he
save
another
even
group
others
whos
life
more
inalienable
leads
classic
question
value
death
penalty
especially
serial
killers
whos
life
liberty
more
valuable
serial
killer
victim
according
beautiful
line
those
two
rights
should
completely
inviolate
noone
should
able
remove
them
includes
government
admittedly
serial
killer
has
restricted
some
people
life
liberty
his
own
life
liberty
inviolate
also
according
declaration
independence
murder
certainly
violation
golden
rule
i
thought
i
had
defined
murder
intentional
killing
non
murderer
against
his
oooh
i
like
means
killing
infant
murder
because
cannot
against
its
reason
infant
has
similarly
people
who
brain
dead
easier
see
coma
etc
also
under
current
law
accidental
killing
still
murder
how
you
include
you
responded
asking
whether
execution
innocent
person
under
our
system
capital
punishment
murder
i
fail
see
what
has
do
anything
i
never
claimed
our
system
morality
objective
one
i
thought
your
very
first
claim
some
kind
objective
morality
example
murder
wrong
you
don
want
claim
any
more
fine
only
real
golden
rule
life
he
who
has
gold
makes
rules
i
e
might
makes
right
survival
now
what
wrong
well
murder
violates
golen
rule
which
certainly
pillar
most
every
moral
system
however
i
am
assuming
our
current
system
manner
its
implementation
objectively
moral
i
think
very
good
approximation
we
can
perfect
you
mean
golden
rule
i
stated
yes
almost
every
system
implemented
has
used
reality
sorry
i
don
deal
much
fiction
i
do
reality
way
you
don
seem
understand
difference
between
arbitrary
objective
keith
schneider
defines
murder
other
arbitrary
jon
livesey
may
still
say
well
according
my
personal
system
morality
all
killing
humans
against
murder
wrong
what
legal
definition
murder
may
usa
kuweit
saudi
arabia
prc
may
matters
whit
me
welcome
ozland
what
arbitrary
you
can
find
some
part
society
some
societal
rules
morals
etc
arbitrary
please
tell
me
i
don
think
any
well
objective
would
assume
system
based
clear
fundamental
concepts
while
arbitary
implies
clear
line
reasoning
keith
sounds
like
euphemisms
me
difference
seems
objective
some
reasoning
i
like
while
arbitrary
some
reasoning
i
don
