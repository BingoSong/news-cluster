i
m
pretty
sure
i
ve
seen
biblical
rules
when
allowable
rape
prisoners
what
codes
about
etc
could
some
more
knowledgable
soul
than
i
please
let
me
know
some
references
he
asked
very
narrow
question
i
gave
very
narrow
answer
yes
sorry
i
have
got
wrong
my
apology

didn
mention
god
nor
did
my
response
you
were
first
bring
up
idea
bible
being
given
god
most
jews
don
believe
any
literal
sense
so
fun
i
must
have
met
minority
given
god
refers
any
action
whereby
god
god
causes
better
effects
something
rob
i
am
intimate
jewish
theology
i
understand
you
messianic
jew
correct
me
i
am
wrong
appears
views
messianic
jews
metaphysics
different
majority
jews
while
jewish
theology
overall
quite
distinct
from
christianic
god
views
i
have
heard
possible
jews
attribute
evil
god
christians
bible
still
seen
effect
interaction
some
god
man
deletion
i
thought
we
agreed
though
jews
disagree
set
core
beliefs
do
agree
upon
one
which
commandments
accessible
written
language
time
another
which
must
legal
system
update
them
context
metaphysics
even
when
process
adapting
commandments
transcendent
justification
process
lie
metaphysic
specualtion
i
wonder
how
you
break
out
shackles
having
metaphysics
your
system
deletion
could
you
explain
respect
original
commandments
being
discussed
commandment
says
you
feel
like
raping
woman
prisoner
you
should
instead
wait
marry
her
what
about
way
commandment
given
invalidates
book
commands
commit
genocide
among
other
reprehensible
deeds
context
repulsive
foul
play
imo
invoke
some
relatively
enlightened
passages
example
content
whole
book
big
deletion
point
i
see
necessary
connection
between
theology
you
use
interpretation
bible
only
very
loosely
my
interpretation
bible
based
long
tradition
jewish
scholars
interpreting
bible
theology
doesn
really
enter
jewish
atheists
who
interpret
laws
charity
essentially
same
way
i
do
interpretation
some
laws
interpretation
bible
example
sodom
gomorrha
mean
argue
god
whole
idea
metaphorically
yet
allows
you
argue
god
whatever
means
alone
theo
logic
question
proof
theology
used
you
pose
another
metaphysical
riddle
you
do
well
you
wrote
fine
so
we
have
some
major
spirit
neither
absolute
power
nor
absolute
knowledge
appears
limited
means
communicate
us
some
form
spiritual
big
friend
do
you
admit
using
god
context
somewhat
unusual
am
i
right
assumption
cannot
have
created
universe
well
passages
bible
referring
its
omnipotence
crap
what
i
meant
riddle
important
question
light
what
instance
passage
witrh
sodom
gomorrha
means
either
some
connection
between
text
fact
exists
your
interpretation
purely
arbitrary
further
question
why
has
one
carry
burden
biblical
texts
when
one
could
simply
write
other
books
convey
message
better
you
might
answer
one
can
becuase
some
peculiar
biblical
information
might
lost
holds
true
every
other
book
question
remains
why
has
bible
still
special
place
can
replaced
somehow
ok
bargain
dangerous
content
bible
against
some
other
message
included
well
deletion
do
you
see
danger
doing
so
especially
metaphers
used
bible
i
think
danger
doing
so
less
than
either
danger
having
frozen
system
laws
having
laws
sorry
worse
systems
does
say
anything
about
one
could
have
better
system
deletion
we
read
two

we
read
two
stories

people
kill
