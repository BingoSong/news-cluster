questions
you
why
do
subjectivists
relativists
nihilists
get
so
het
up
about
idea
relativism
better
than
objectivism
degree
relativism
more
accurate
decription
truth
than
objectivism
provides
more
power
ability
control
events
i
think
you
lose
right
talk
about
truth
once
you
say
values
relative
accuracy
value
judgement
too
so
happens
i
agree
substance
what
you
say
below
clear
me
least
some
values
objective
truth
better
than
falsehood
peace
better
than
war
education
better
than
ignorance
we
know
things
we
know
anything
while
i
ll
agree
generally
held
good
things
i
question
whether
come
very
close
being
objective
values
especially
considering
one
time
another
each
has
been
viewed
being
undesirable
i
doubt
you
could
even
come
up
anything
could
said
universally
good
bad
when
i
referred
truth
i
using
term
hypothetically
realizing
full
well
may
even

morals
relative
two
relativists
can
recognize
neither
has
lock
absolute
truth
can
proceed
negotiate
workable
compromise
produces
desired
results
cannot
because
acknowledge
up
front
desired
results
do
exist
after
all
meaning
compromise
plus
some
problems
relativists
have
values
common
compromise
impossible
what
happens
who
anyone
right
what
happens
one
relativist
has
value
never
compromise

plant

after
all
morals
relative
values
cannot
meaningfully
said
incorrect
true
enough
cannot
said
anything
more
than
personal
morals
one
thing
notably
lacking
most
extremists
any
sense
personal
accountability
justification
any
socially
unacceptable
behaviour
invariably
some
higher
authority
aka
absolute
moral
truth
assuming
absolute

two
disagreeing
objectivists
can
either
both

just
one

right
room
compromise
once
you
beleive
absolute
morals
you
must
accept
you
amoral
everyone
who
disagrees
you
amoral
untrue
one
can

one
does
know
whole
truth
part
objective
truth
about
morality
may
well
flexibility
better
than
rigidity
compromise
better
than
believing
you
have
lock
morals
etc
same
way
i
can
believe
objective
reality
without

cannot

compromise
good
compromise
absolute
truth
something
most
people
do
very
successfully
i
suppose
one
could
hold
compromise
being
absolute
moral
what
happens
when
someone
else
insists
compromise
how
do
you
compromise
compromising
given
choice
between
peaceful
compromise
endless
contention
i
d
say
compromise
seems
better
i
would
agree
bloody
pointless
speak
merely
matter
taste
your
liking
peace
any
better
founded
than
someone
else
liking
ice

i
m
looking
way
say
yes
question
relativism
isn
almost
invariably
when
considering
relative
value
one
thing
over
another
morals
consequences
people
only
consider
those
aspects
which
justify
desired
action
belief
justifying
commitement
peace
i
might
argue
lets
people
live

healthy
peaceful
lives
