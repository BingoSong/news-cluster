dan
lawrence
bissell
writes
some
reasons
why
he
wouldn
liar
follows
who
would
die
lie
wouldn
people
able
tell
he
liar
people
gathered
around
him
kept
doing
many
gathered
from
hearing
seeing
someone
who
had
been
healed
call
me
fool
i
believe
he
did
heal
people
anyone
who
dies
cause
runs
risk
dying
lie
people
being
able
tell
he
liar
well
we
ve
had
grifters
charlatans
since
beginning
civilization
david
copperfield
had
been
messiah
i
bet
he
could
have
found
plenty
believers
jesus
hardly
first
claim
faith
healer
he
wasn
first
witnessed
what
sets
him
apart
niether
he
lunatic
would
more
than
entire
nation
drawn
someone
who
crazy
very
doubtful
fact
rediculous
example
anyone
who
drawn
david
koresh
obviously
fool
logical
people
see
right
away
rubbish
nations
have
followed
crazies
liars
psychopaths
megalomaniacs
throughout
history
hitler
tojo
mussolini
khomeini
qadaffi
stalin
papa
doc
nixon
come
mind
all
from
century
koresh
non
issue
therefore
since
he
wasn
liar
lunatic
he
must
have
been
real
thing
take
discrete
mathematics
formal
logic
course
flaws
your
logic
everywhere
i
m
sure
others
tell
you
read
faq
some
other
things
note
he
fulfilled
loads
prophecies
psalms
isaiah
elsewhere
hrs
alone
his
betrayal
crucifixion
i
don
have
my
bible
me
moment
next
time
i
write
i
use
course
you
have
believe
bible
first
just
because
something
written
bible
does
mean
true
age
tome
plus
lack
external
supporting
evidence
makes
less
credible
so
you
do
quote
from
bible
future
try
back
up
quote
supporting
evidence
otherwise
you
get
flamed
mercilessly
i
don
think
most
people
understand
what
christian
certainly
what
i
see
lot
churches
rather
i
think
should
way
life
total
sacrafice
everything
god
sake
he
loved
us
enough
die
save
us
so
we
should
do
same
hey
we
can
do
god
himself
inspires
us
turn
our
lives
over
him
tuff
most
people
don
want
do
real
christian
would
something
strong
persevere
just
like
weight
lifting
guitar
playing
drums
whatever
takes
time
we
don
rush
one
day
christianity
your
whole
life
going
church
once
week
helping
poor
people
once
while
we
box
everything
time
units
work
time
sports
tv
social
life
god
above
boxes
should
carried
us
all
boxes
we
have
created
ourselves
just
like
weight
lifting
guitar
playing
eh
i
don
know
how
you
define
world
total
i
would
imagine
total
sacrafice
sp
everything
god
sake
would
involve
more
than
time
commitment
you
correct
about
our
tendency
box
everything
time
units
would
you
explain
how
one
should
involove
god
sports
