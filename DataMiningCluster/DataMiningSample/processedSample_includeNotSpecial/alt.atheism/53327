re
who
has
read
rushdie
satanic
verses
another
one
rescued
from
bit
bucket
over
years
furor
over
book
has
been
discussed
elsewhere
net
generally
discussion
comes
down
contention
one
hand
tsv
contains
blood
libel
against
islam
merit
death
than
least
banning
probably
some
sort
punishment
other
rushdie
particularly
non
muslim
western
country
had
every
right
write
publish
whatever
he
chose
regardless
whether
some
muslims
find
offensive
without
fear
persecution
death
i
am
naturally
inclined
latter
position
find
myself
interesting
position
because
i
think
fine
book
only
incidentally
concerned
islam
moreover
i
m
damned
i
can
find
anything
malevolently
offensive
over
years
when
i
have
made
point
various
primarily
muslim
posters
have
responded
saying
yes
indeed
have
read
book
had
called
things
filth
lies
i
would
rank
rushdie
book
hitler
mein
kempf
worse
so
unfortunately
comments
usually
generalities
attempts
follow
up
requesting
explanations
what
specifically
so
offensive
have
met
either
stony
silence
more
generalizations
inaccurate
out
context
references
book
which
lead
me
believe
few
them
have
actually
read
corrections
attempts
discuss
text
context
have
been
ignored
anyway
since
i
seem
only
one
following
particular
line
discussion
i
wonder
how
many
rest
readership
have
read
book
what
your
thoughts
