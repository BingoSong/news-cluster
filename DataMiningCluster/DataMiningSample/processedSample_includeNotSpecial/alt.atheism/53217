explain
me
how
instinctive
acts
can
moral
acts
i
am
happy
listen
example
were
instinctive
murder
murdering
would
have
moral
significance
since
would
nothing
voluntary
about
see
you
go
again
saying
moral
act
only
significant
voluntary
why
do
you
think
anyway
humans
have
ability
disregard
some
instincts
so
only
intelligent
beings
can
moral
even
bahavior
other
beings
mimics
theirs
you
starting
get
point
mimicry
necessarily
same
action
being
imitated
parrot
saying
pretty
polly
isn
necessarily
commenting
pulchritude
polly
you
attaching
too
many
things
term
moral
i
think
let
try
good
animals
same
species
don
kill
each
other
do
you
think
right
do
you
think
animals
machines
nothing
do
either
right
nor
wrong
animals
same
species
could
kill
each
other
arbitarily
don
do
i
other
posters
have
given
you
many
examples
exactly
you
seem
have
very
short
memory
those
weren
arbitrary
killings
were
slayings
related
some
sort
mating
ritual
whatnot
you
trying
say
isn
act
morality
because
most
animals
aren
intelligent
enough
think
like
we
do
i
m
saying
must
possibility
organism
just
people
we
talking
about
can
consider
alternatives
right
posting
you
replying
yes
i
still
don
understand
your
distinctions
what
do
you
mean
consider
can
small
child
moral
how
about
gorilla
dolphin
platypus
where
line
drawn
does
being
need
self
aware
what
do
you
call
mechanism
which
seems
prevent
animals
same
species
from
arbitrarily
killing
each
other
don
you
find
fact
don
all
significant
