benedikt
what
difference
between
those

agreeing
trivial
observation
reference
yet
being

dubious
you
have
used
terms
absolute
objective
others
interchangeably
same

from

were

fulfilled
your

you

argue
point
you
have
made
interesting
statement
here
namely
disinterested
observer
thing
morals
probably
shortest
proof
objective
morality
being
contradiction
one
you
have
never
given
set
morals
people
agree
upon
unlike
football
further
you
conveniently
ignore
here
many
who
would
agree
tghe
morality
something
analogy
does
hold
i
have
however
given

could

you
have
nothing

your
strong
claims
one
can
expect
sufficiently
many

its
being

while
you
have
give

you
have

we
can

only
cogent
objection
my

maybe
people
aren
talking
about

maybe
i
want
think
about
some

its
being

clutching
straw
i
don
believe

those
who
