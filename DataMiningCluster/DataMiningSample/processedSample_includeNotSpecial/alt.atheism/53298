wrote
now
what
i
am
interested
original
notion
you
were
discussing
moral
free
agency
how
can
god
punish
person
believing
him
when
person
only
following
his
her
nature
possible
person
deny
what
his
her
reason
tells
him
her
which
god
i
think
you
re
letting
atheist
mythology
confuse
you
issue
webster
myth
traditional
legendary
story
belief
whose
truth
accepted
uncritically
how
does
qualify
indeed
almost
oxymoronic
rather
amusing
instance
i
ve
found
most
atheists
hold
almost
atheist
views
accepted
uncritically
especially
few
legend
many
trying
explain
basic
truths
myths
do
don
meet
other
criterions
also
divine
justice
according
most
fundamental
doctrines
christianity
when
first
man
sinned
he
time
you
accuse
him
referencing
mythology
you
procede
launch
your
own
xtian
mythology
time
meeting
all
requirements
myth
salvation
idea
punishment
based
proposition
everyone
knows
instinctively
god
exists
creator
ah
everyone
knows
god
exists
so
you
have
fallacy
nothing
terribly
difficult
all
well
known
any
reasonably
biblically
literate
christian
only
controversy
makes
true
holding
bible
rules
out
controversy
read
faq
you
ve
read
you
missed
something
so
re
read
bad
suggestion
anyone
i
re
read
just
before
those
who
pretend
know
what
being
said
what
means
when
atheists
claim
do
know
god
exists
don
know
what
he
wants
contradict
bible
which
clearly
says
everyone
knows
authority
bible
its
claim
should
i
repeat
what
i
wrote
above
sake
getting
across
you
may
trust
bible
your
trusting
doesn
make
any
more
credible
me
bible
says
everyone
knows
clearly
reason
doubt
bible
because
everyone
knows
your
alleged
god
alleged
existance
refuted
while
species
wide
condemnation
justified
those
claim
evidence
existence
god
his
unknown
must
deliberately
ignore
bible
ignorance
itself
excuse
don
have
ignore
bible
bible
far
from
universally
accepted
bible
proof
god
only
proof
some
people
have
thought
god
does
prove
even
might
have
been
writing
series
fiction
short
stories
case
dionetics
assuming
writers
believed
only
thing
could
possibly
prove
believed
ignoring
problem
whether
all
interpretations
biblical
philosophers
were
correct
people
who
have
truly
never
heard
bible
again
read
faq
freedom
you
free
ignore
god
same
way
you
free
ignore
gravity
consequences
inevitable
well
known
both
cases
atheist
can
accept
evidence
means
only
bzzt
wrong
answer
gravity
directly
doesn
stop
exerting
direct
rationally
undeniable
influence
you
ignore
god
other
hand
doesn
generally
show
up
supermarket
except
tabloids
god
doesn
exert
rationally
undeniable
influence
gravity
obvious
gods
aren
secondly
human
reason
very
comforatble
concept
god
so
much
so
itself
intrinsic
our
nature
human
reason
always
comes
back
question
god
every
generation
human
reason
hasn
always
come
back
existance
god
has
usually
come
back
existance
god
other
words
doesn
generally
come
back
xtian
god
comes
back
whether
any
god
much
oriental
philosophic
history
generally
doesn
pop
up
idea
god
so
much
question
what
natural
forces
which
ones
out
from
world
wide
view
human
nature
just
makes
us
wonder
how
universe
came
what
force
currently
control
natural
tendancy
believe
god
only
exists
religious
wishful
thinking
i
said
all
make
point
christianity
eminently
reasonable
divine
justice
just
human
nature
much
different
than
what
atheists
think
whether
you
agree
xtianity
more
reasonable
than
most
other
religions
reasonableness
certainly
doesn
merit
eminence
divine
justice
well
only
seems
just
those
who
already
believe
divinity
first
all
atheists
believe
same
things
about
human
nature
second
whether
most
atheists
correct
you
certainly
correct
human
nature
you
least
basing
your
views
completely
eurocentric
approach
try
looking
outside
world
well
when
you
attempt
sum
up
all
humanity
