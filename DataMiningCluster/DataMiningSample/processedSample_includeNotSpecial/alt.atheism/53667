theism
correlated
fanaticism
i
have
neither
said
all
fanatism
caused
theism
nor
all
theism
leads
fanatism
point
theism
increases
chance
becoming
fanatic
one
could
course
argue
would
fanatics
tend
towards
theism
example
i
just
have
loook
times
history
when
theism
dominant
ideology
invalidate
conclusion
basic
mechanism
behind
imo
influence
stalin
matter
ayn
rand
invalidates
your
assumption
theism
factor
considered
bogus
i
just
said
theism
only
factor
fanatism
point
theism
factor
your
claim
now
back
up
i
consider
your
argument
useful
following
belief
strongly
correlated
fanaticism
therefore
belief
factor
fanaticism
true
utterly
useless
note
any
belief
belief
gods
gullibility
blind
obedience
authority
lack
scepticism
so
all
more
reliable
indicators
really
dangerous
people
sources
fanaticism
often
none
things
cynical
manipulators
gullible
who
know
precisely
what
doing
claim
you
have
support
please
note
especially
field
theism
leaders
believe
what
say
you
believe
you
re
incredibly
naive
now
some
brands
theism
more
precisely
some
theists
do
tend
fanaticism
i
grant
you
tar
all
theists
brush
bigotry
reasoned
argument
reads
me
like
warm
up
censorship
restriction
religious
freedom
ever
read
animal
farm
straw
man
usually
discussions
you
one
has
repeat
read
what
i
have
written
above
every
theism
leads
fanatism
all
fanatism
caused
theism
point
correlation
comes
from
innate
features
theism
some
comes
from
features
which
some
theism
has
common
some
fanaticism
your
last
statement
simply
isn
implied
what
you
say
before
because
you
re
trying
sneak
innate
features
all
theism
word
you
re
groping
some
gullibility
way
one
them
shit
sherlock
so
why
talk
about
gullibility
instead
theism
since
seems
whole
lot
more
relevant
case
you
have
opposed
case
you
trying
make
say
i
am
going
forbid
religion
another
your
straw
men
interesting
you
have
nothing
better
offer
i
said
reads
like
warm
up
because
irrational
bogus
tirade
has
other
use
than
creating
nice
them
us
split
minds
excitable
people
found
either
side
church
walls
define
irrational
belief
e
g
rational
believe
reason
always
useful
irrational
belief
belief
based
upon
reason
latter
has
been
discussed
long
time
charley
wingate
one
point
beliefs
violate
reason
often
another
process
does
lend
itself
rational
analysis
does
contain
reliable
information
well
glaring
paradox
here
argument
reason
useful
based
reason
would
circular
argument
based
reason
would
irrational
which
bogus
self
reference
circular
since
evaluation
usefulness
possible
within
rational
systems
allowed
o
k
oval
still
begging
question
however
though
certainly
allowed
rational
you
claiming
rational
all
risk
repeating
myself
hearing
we
had
before
we
didn
hear
refutation
before
so
we
re
back
deal
you
can
use
reason
demonstrate
reason
useful
someone
who
thinks
reason
crap
won
buy
you
see
your
argument
silly
proving
mathematical
statements
needs
mathematics
mathematics
therfore
circular
anybody
else
think
godel
silly
first
part
second
statement
contains
information
because
you
don
say
what
beliefs
beliefs
strong
theism
strong
atheism
your
statement
general
true
second
part
your
sentence
patently
false
counterexample
axiomatic
datum
does
lend
itself
rational
analysis
assumed
contain
reliable
information
regardless
what
process
used
obtain
i
ve
been
speaking
religious
systems
contradictory
definitions
god
here
axiomatic
datum
lends
itself
rational
analysis
what
you
say
here
often
refuted
fallacy
have
look
discussion
axiom
choice
further
one
can
evaluate
axioms
larger
systems
out
which
usually
derived
i
exist
derived
you
want
way
further
one
can
test
consistency
so
set
axioms
what
you
trying
say
some
point
people
always
wind
up
saying
datum
reliable
particular
reason
all
example
i
am
dreaming
compared
evidence
theists
have
claims
strength
demands
makes
whole
thing
only
irrational
antirational
i
can
agree
until
you
specific
which
theism
say
all
theism
necessarily
antirational
requires
proof
which
i
suspect
you
do
have
using
traditonal
definition
gods
personal
supernatural
entities
objective
effects
world
usually
connected
morals
way
world
works
imo
any
belief
about
gods
necessarily
irrational
does
mean
people
who
hold
them
principle
opposed
exercise
intelligence
some
atheists
also
scientists
example
affinity
fanatism
easily
seen
has
true
because
i
believe
nothing
more
than
work
hypothesis
however
beliefs
say
more
than
work
hypothesis
i
don
understand
can
you
formalise
your
argument
person
believes
system
b
becuase
sounds
so
nice
does
make
b
true
best
work
hypothesis
however
content
b
true
more
than
work
hypothesis
testing
evaluating
evidence
against
therefore
dismissed
because
b
already
believed
says
wrong
waste
time
possible
depending
further
contents
b
amalekites
idolaters
protestants
killed
can
have
interesting
effects
peculiar
definition
interesting
sure
now
show
belief
gods
entails
further
contents
which
you
speak
why
aren
my
catholic
neighbours
out
killing
protestants
example
maybe
don
believe
maybe
conjunction
b
asserts
b
jail
kill
dissenters
important
belief
gods
entirely
irrelevant
certainly
seems
so

i
