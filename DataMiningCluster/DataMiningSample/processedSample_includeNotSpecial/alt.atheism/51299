fred
rice
writes
has
been
some
discussion
pros
cons
about
sex
outside
marriage
where
evidence
my
opinions
moment
just
generalities
i
can
cite
example
i
read
th
century
percentage
youth
people
general
who
suffer
from
depression
has
been
steadily
climbing
western
societies
probably
what
i
reading
referred
particularly
usa
similarly
one
can
detect
trend
towards
greater
occurrence
sex
outside
marriage
century
western
societies
particularly
sexual
revolution
even
before
i
think
otherwise
sexual
revolution
would
have
been
possible
particularly
gradual
weakening
christianity
consequently
christian
moral
teachings
against
sex
outside
marriage
i
propose
two
trends
greater
level
general
depression
society
other
psychological
problems
greater
sexual
promiscuity
linked
latter
being
prime
cause
former
i
cannot
provide
any
evidence
beyond
stage
whole
thesis
seems
very
reasonable
me
i
request
people
ponder
upon
fred
rice
muslim
giving
his
point
view
darice

au
i
think
big
leap
sex
depression
one
example
myself
where
sex
depression
seriously
promiscuity
decline
depression
might
more
reasonable
say
depression
promiscuity
i
think
depression
more
likely
come
from
emotional
problems
relationships
family
job
friends
promiscuity
used
escape
since
i
see
marriage
civil
religious
bond
rather
than
emotional
bond
i
don
see
problem
sex
before
outside
marriage
so
long
you
have
same
commitment
devotion
what
expected
from
married
couple
course
just
my
opinion
