i
made
my
statement
about
ockums
razor
from
my
experiences
physics
thanks
info
baysian
statistics
very
interesting
i
didn
know
before
i
follow
your
proof
i
have
one
questions
we
have
two
hypotheses
h
hg
latter
more
complicated
which
definition
means
p
h
p
hg
complicated
isn
fact
where
p
h
p
hg
comes
from
more
other
way
around
from
p
h
p
hg
p
hg
where
g
complement
g
axiom
p
anything
so
p
hg
so
p
h
p
hg
sense
hg
necessarily
more
complicated
than
h
any
h
g
so
i
may
splitting
hairs
what
i
m
trying
say
irrespective
subjective
impressions
how
complicated
something
p
h
p
hg
holds
equality
only
p
hg
you
point
out
very
simple
matter
show
p
x
h
p
x
hg
p
h
x
p
hg
x
thus
h
preferd
hg
now
say
h
consistent
data
hg
say
p
x
h
p
x
hg
can
you
elaborate
some
well
p
x
p
x
b
means
x
likely
observed
operative
b
operative
implies
observing
x
does
provide
any
useful
information
which
might
allow
us
discriminate
between
respective
possibilities
b
operative
difference
reduces
difference
between
unknown
unhelpful
prior
probabilities
p
p
b
p
x
p
x
b
p
x
k
p
p
b
x
k
p
b
where
k
p
x
p
x
p
x
b
p
x
so
b
equally
consistent
data
observing
x
doesn
give
any
pointers
which
b
operative
particular
case
where
h
b
hg
however
we
know
prior
probabilities
ordered
p
h
p
hg
although
we
don
know
actual
values
which
allows
us
deploy
razor
throw
out
any
hg
also
real
world
isn
clear
cut
dry
seems
me
we
can
always
determine
whether
equality
p
x
h
p
x
hg
true
certainly
true
particular
point
here
whether
divine
component
actually
underlies
prevalence
religion
addition
memetic
transmission
component
which
even
religious
implicitly
acknowledge
operative
when
talk
spreading
word
now
seems
me
i
ve
said
observed
variance
religious
belief
well
accounted
memetic
transmission
model
rather
less
well
one
proposes
divine
component
addition
since
i
would
expect
latter
conspire
against
wide
variance
even
mutual
exclusion
among
beliefs
thus
my
personal
feeling
p
x
hg
isn
even
equal
p
x
h
case
smaller
h
memetic
transmission
g
divine
component
x
variance
among
beliefs
i
happily
acknowledge
subjective
impression
btw
my
beef
your
baysian
argument
mathematical
one
i
checked
most
your
work
didn
find
error
you
seem
very
careful
so
probably
isn
math
mistake
i
think
mistake
philosophical
just
make
sure
i
understand
you
can
please
rephrase
non
technical
terms
i
think
reasonable
request
i
always
try
look
ways
explaining
physics
non
physicist
i
m
baysian
statistician
nor
any
type
statistician
so
would
very
helpful
i
m
statistician
either
idea
both
theism
atheism
compatible
all
read
my
observations
date
however
theism
type
which
i
am
concerned
also
suggests

prayer
may
answered
people
may
miraculously
healed
both
principle
amenable
statistical
verification
god
may
generally
intervene
measurable
ways
means
regions
space
possible
observations
which
i
loosely
termed
appearances
god
have
some
nonzero
probability
under
theistic
hypothesis
zero
under
atheistic
since
only
so
much
probability
available
each
hypothesis
scatter
around
over
observation
space
probability
which
theism
expends
making
appearances
god
possible
must
come
from
somewhere
else
i
e
other
possible
observations
all
else
being
equal
means
observation
which
isn
appearance
god
must
have
slightly
higher
probability
under
atheism
than
under
theism
bayesian
stuff
implies
observations
must
cause
my
running
estimate
probability
atheistic
hypothesis
increase
corresponding
decrease
my
running

probability
theistic
hypothesis
sorry
still
bit

quite
frequently
i
agree
you
lack

your

god

does

i
should

maybe
i
too
quick
say
we
had
common
language
you
said
existence
god
you
mean
notion
deity
described
bible
christians
does
interact
universe
claimed
those
agents
i
agreed
however
i
must
careful
here
i
believe
i
m
making
any
claims
maybe
i
should
have
changed
does
can
important
shift
emphasis
any
way
since
i
only
have
belief
i
cannot
conclude
p
x
ht
x
ok
we
ll
downgrade
does
interact
may
interact
which
would
actually
better
since
does
interact
implies
falsifiability
which
we
both
agree
misplaced
i
don
think
my
theism
makes
predictions
maybe
i
m
understanding
what
you
mean
prediction
could
you
explain
what
you
mean
word
i
ll
explain
bear
mind
isn
central
all
i
require
theism
make
prediction
appearances
god
never
happen
does
atheism
before
somebody
points
out
quantum
mechanics
doesn
make

either
difference
qm
atheism
do
form
partition
predictions
include

prayer

you
do

you

verily
i

i
don

we

though
may
more
consistent
ha
explained

even

god

unfalsifiable
problem
my
argument
other
than
you
have
let
number
observations
go
infinity
falsify
asymptotically
btw
i
do
consider
argument
requires
infinite
number
observations
valid
rather
part
argument
valid
we
existing
humans
can
never
make
infinite
number
measurments
any
conclusion
reilies
i
don
accept
valid
fine
i
don
claim
theism
false
merely
finite
number
observations
available
me
so
far
suggest
i
continue
observe
suggestion
looks
better
better
renormalization
stuff
deleted
bayesian
stats
post
i
assumed
theism
indeed
unfalsifiable
finite
number
observations
here
relevant
quote
important
assumption
some
observations
which
compatible
theist
hypothesis
atheist
hypothesis
thus
would
falsify
atheism
what
i
called
appearances
god
need
taken
too
literally
any
observation
which
requires
its
explanation
one
more
gods
exist
count
all
other
observations
assumed
compatible
both
hypotheses
leaves
theism
unfalsifiable
atheism
falsifiable
single
observation
only
appearances
god
here
my
problem
something
falsifiable
must
make
prediction
x
should
seen
x
seen
hypothesis
has
been
falsified
now
atheism
word
oposition
something
theism
theism
aserts
belief
atheism
aserts
disbelief
so
certain
atheisms
certainly
falsifiable
just
certain
theisms
falsifable
e
g
my
theism
asserts
world
only
years
old
god
does
decieve
has
been
falsified
however
atheism
oposition
unfalsifiable
theism
also
unfalsifiable
i
could
wrong
statment
contd
i
think
you
appearance
god
sufficient
falsify
atheism
whereas
general
corresponding
theism
unfalsifiable
i
ll
think
more
about
until
here
general
question
suppse
x
were
unfalsifiable
x
also
unfalsifiable
way
counterexample
let
x
coin
fair
more
accurately
so
x
makes
sense
two
sides
coin
different
unfalsifiable
tossing
coin
even
string
heads
consistent
fair
coin
you
have
go
infinite
number
tosses
falsify
x
limit
its
converse
falsifiable
falsified
when
least
one
head
least
one
tail
have
appeared
partly
what
wrong
you
baysian
argument
which
requires
observations
x
x
n
made
simply
observations
have
truth
value
relation
statement
god
exists
now
use
your
symmetry
argument
i
can
understand
why
someone
would
say
since
statement
god
does
exist
makes
predictions
i
choose
believe
none
less
would
founded
type
faith
you
don
like
word
faith
insert
belief
which
falsifiable
evidence
instead
i
ll
assume
you
meant
god
exists
up
highlight
our
agreed
definition
exists
statement
makes
predictions
i
said
above
although
isn
falsifiable
finite
number
observations
actually
i
mean
god
does
exist
makes
predictions
oops
sorry
mea
culpa
truth
statment
actually
depends
upon
which
god
you
refering
i
can
think
some
conceptions
god
which
true
once
again
i
m
open
posibility
i
could
wrong
so
give
me
some
examples
predictions
statment
god
does
exist
here
one
i
can
think

seem

situations
do

happen
consistent
theistic

way
support

we
agree
here
inconsistent
atheistic
hypothesis
i
can
think
one
prediction
from
god
does
exist
isn
type
i
might
missing
something
rapture
happen
october
said
rapture
would
have
falsified
atheism
my
satisfaction
had
happened
although
its
failure
happen
does
course
falsify
any
theisms
other
than
those
which
specifically
predicted
phenomenon
which

one
