re
gospel
dating
so
you
require
same
amount
evidence
believe
i
own
pair
bluejeans
b
have
superhuman
powers
well
i
could
use
argument
some
here
use
about
nature
claim
you
cannot
have
superhuman
powers
because
you
human
superhuman
powers
beyond
what
human
has
since
you
human
any
powers
you
have
beyond
those
human
hence
you
cannot
have
superhuman
powers
sound
good
you
anyway
evidence
question
depends
context
group
since
you
posting
from
american
college
site
i
m
willing
take
given
you
have
pair
blue
jeans
assuming
some
coherency
your
position
i
take
given
you
do
have
superhuman
powers
arguments
evidence
themselves
some
respects
when
you
say
existence
sic
jesus
i
assume
you
mean
just
man
without
any
special
powers
etc
yep
many
agree
very
possible
man
called
jesus
did
fact
live
fact
i
am
willing
agree
some
man
named
jesus
i
have
reason
believe
wasn
ever
man
good
however
most
claims
extradinary
eg
virgin
birth
virgin
sense
having
any
sexual
intercourse
resurection
son
god
etc
those
claims
require
extra
evidence
extra
evidence
why
don
we
start
evidence
all
i
cannot
see
any
evidence
v
b
which
cynics
group
would
ever
accept
second
foundation
religion
anyone
who
claims
have
seen
risen
jesus
back
day
period
believer
therefore
discounted
those
group
since
all
ancients
anyway
one
again
choose
dismiss
whole
thing
third
much
metaphysical
relationship
anything
else
even
those
who
agree
have
argued
length
over
what
means
so
again
i
don
see
how
evidence
possible
i
thus
interpret
extraordinary
claims
claim
statement
speaker
accept
any
evidence
