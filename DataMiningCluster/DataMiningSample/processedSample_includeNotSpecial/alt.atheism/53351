my
turn
i
went
back
reread
your
post
all
you
did
attack
atheism
say
agnosticism
wasn
funny
atheism
nowhere
does
imply
you
agnostic
weak
atheist
most
people
who
post
inflammatory
remarks
theists
reasonable
assumption
sorry
you
re
right
i
did
clearly
state
rule
condescending
population
large
i
e
theists
win
many
people
your
faith
anytime
soon
only
ruins
your
credibility
how
am
i
being
condescending
population
large
i
am
stating
something
happened
true
long
time
i
couldn
believe
people
actually
believed
god
idea
alien
concept
me
i
am
trying
win
people
my
faith
you
put
i
have
faith
religion
non
issue
when
i
had
attitude
above
because
never
even
occurred
me
believe
atheist
default
i
guess
you
could
say
most
common
form
condescending
rational
versus
irrational
attitude
once
one
has
accepted
assumption
god
consider
other
faiths
irrational
simply
because
assumption
contradict
your
assumption
i
would
say
lack
consistency
here
now
i
know
you
ll
get
me
about
faith
positive
belief
god
does
exist
were
closed
logical
argument
why
do
so
many
rational
people
have
problems
logic
you
probably
like
me
seem
soft
atheist
sorry
flamage
line
about
atheists
haveing
something
up
sleeves
what
seemed
imply
sorry
been
reading
too
much
clipper
project
lately
paranoia
over
may
have
seeped
some
what
clipper
project
btw
rule
don
mix
apples
oranges
how
can
you
say
extermination
mongols
worse
than
stalin
khan
conquered
people
unsympathetic
his
cause
atrocious
stalin
killed
millions
his
own
people
who
loved
worshipped
him
his
atheist
state
how
can
anyone
worse
than
many
rulers
have
done
similar
things
past
only
stalin
did
when
plenty
documentation
afix
blame
him
evidence
some
early
european
rulers
ruled
iron
fist
much
like
stalin
you
threw
numbers
i
am
sick
hearing
about
stalin
example
because
example
doesn
apply
you
managed
get
me
angry
your
post
because
appeared
attack
all
forms
atheism
might
have
appeared
attack
atheism
general
its
point
mass
killing
happens
all
sorts
reasons
people
hate
who
wave
whatever
flag
justify
cross
hammer
sickle
stalin
example
important
only
because
still
widely
unappreciated
era
people
want
forget
also
because
people
really
did
love
him
his
ideas
even
after
all
he
had
wrought
evidence
i
am
referring
more
lack
evidence
than
negative
evidence
say
i
claim
pink
crows
i
have
never
seen
pink
crow
doesn
mean
couldn
exist
person
here
claims
pink
crows
even
though
he
admits
he
hasn
been
able
capture
one
get
photo
find
one
me
etc
sense
evidence
believe
existence
pink
crows
what
i
am
saying
when
i
look
evidence
i
look
suppossed
evidence
deity
show
how
flawed
doesn
show
what
theists
want
show
go
first
all
pink
crows
unicorns
elves
arguments
world
sway
most
people
simply
do
accept
analogy
why
one
big
reasons
many
many
people
want
something
beyond
life
you
can
pretend
don
want
i
one
can
accept
even
want
myself
sometimes
nothing
unique
example
why
people
want
god
can
love
truth
proven
logically
themselves
namely
god
gods
so
principle
hard
see
how
theists
necessarily
arrogant
makes
sense
me
seem
arrogant
make
claim
me
my
previous
refutation
still
stands
i
believe
may
another
one
net
john
baptist
boasted
jesus
many
people
i
find
hard
see
how
behavior
arrogant
all
many
christians
i
know
also
boast
way
i
still
do
necessarily
see
arrogance
course
i
do
know
arrogant
christians
doctors
teachers
well
technically
you
might
consider
person
who
originally
made
given
claim
arrogant
jesus
instance
you
talking
about
all
atheism
just
strong
atheism
you
talking
about
weak
atheism
which
i
believe
i
refuse
claim
atheism
lack
belief
i
used
good
ol
occam
razor
make
final
rejection
deity
i
see
things
even
i
present
hypothesises
equal
fasion
i
find
theist
argument
plausible
i
speak
against
strong
atheism
i
also
often
find
evidence
supporting
faith
very
subjective
just
say
evidence
supporting
love
truth
subjective
i
believe
i
answered
i
apologize
you
stated
incorrect
assumption
your
theism
i
saw
nothing
indicate
you
were
agnostic
only
you
were
just
another
newbie
christian
net
trying
get
some
cheap
shots
apology
necessary

nothing
higher

more
