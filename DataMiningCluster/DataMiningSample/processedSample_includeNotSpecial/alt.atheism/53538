would
probably
consider

probably
because
rape
simple
logic
arguments
folly
you
read
bible
you
see
jesus
made
fools
those
who
tried
trick
him
logic
our
ability
reason
just
spec
creation
yet
some
think
ultimate
you
rely
simply
your
reason
you
never
know
more
than
you
do
now
your
argument
type
you
ll
know
once
you
try
yet
many
atheists
who
have
sincerely
tried
believed
many
years
were
eventually
honest
enough
admit
had
lived
virtual
reality
obviously
many
christians
who
have
tried
do
believe
so
so
nothing
may
work
some
others
doesn
give
any
insight
overall
god
overall
truth
religion
would
seem
dependent
solely
individual
well
individually
created
since
christians
have
failed
show
us
how
way
life
any
wy
better
than
ours
i
do
see
why
attempt
try
necessary
even
particularly
attractive
learn
you
must
accept
which
you
don
know
what
does
mean
learn
you
must
accept
you
don
know
something
right
o
learn
you
must
accept
something
i
don
know
why
way
i
prefer
learn
unwise
merely
swallow
everything
you
read
suppose
i
write
book
telling
how
great
invisible
pink
unicorn
tm
has
helped
me
my
daily
problems
would
you
accept
since
you
can
know
whether
true
one
asks
you
swallow
everything
fact
jesus
warns
against
let
me
ask
you
question
do
you
beleive
what
you
learn
history
class
matter
anything
school
i
mean
just
what
other
people
have
told
you
you
don
want
swallow
what
others
say
right
well
we
nerver
know
sure
we
were
told
truth
very
least
bit
more
evidence
pointing
fact
say
military
conflict
vietnam
years
ago
supernatural
diety
who
wants
us
live
certain
way
fact
jesus
warned
against
means
nothing
i
warn
against
too
big
deal
life
death
resurection
christ
documented
historical
fact
true
first
two
choices
here
life
death
scantily
documented
last
one
total
malarky
unless
one
uses
bible
totally
circular
perhaps
better
use
imagination
one
ignorance
someone
else
address
i
m
sure
refer
you
plenty
documentation
much
anything
else
you
learn
how
do
you
choose
what
believe
what
i
could
argue
george
washington
myth
he
never
lived
because
i
don
have
any
proof
except
what
i
am
told
however
all
major
events
life
jesus
christ
were
fortold
hundreds
years
before
him
neat
trick
uh
how
nothing
more
disgusting
than
christian
attempts
manipulate
interpret
old
testament
being
filled
signs
coming
christ
every
little
reference
stick
bit
wood
autmoatically
interpreted
cross
what
miscarriage
philology
way
get
sceptical
heart
you
can
say
you
have
given
sincere
effort
attitude
you
seem
have
you
must
trust
just
go
church
participate
activities
were
you
ever
willing
die
what
you
believed
well
since
we
have
skeptical
hearts
thank
goodness
way
get
us
here
we
have
irreconcilable
difference
christians
glorify
exactly
what
we
tend
despise
snub
trust
belief
faith
without
knowledge
i
am
lucky
one
day
i
happen
thinking
god
same
time
my
enkephalins
go
up
i
may
associate
sign
god
feel
right
i
trust
without
knowing
maybe
religosity
does
seem
anything
conclusively
arrived
rather
seems
more
sudden
affliction
i
believe
many
us
were
willing
die
what
we
believed
many
us
were
question
suchg
attitude
reflective
correct
healthy
morality
would
seem
same
thing
could
reflect
fanaticism
example
any
case
expression
simple
selfishness

cooper
verily
often
have
i
laughed
weaklings
who
thought
