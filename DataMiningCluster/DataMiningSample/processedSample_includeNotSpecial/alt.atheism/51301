should
we
british
go
around
blowing
up
skyscrapers
next
i
don
know
you
doing
so
seems
you
implying
person
accused
blowing
up
wtc
ny
actually
did
islamic
teachings
have
something
do
blowing
up
wtc
wtc
world
trade
centre
which
building
blown
up
i
think
okay
make
some
comments
person
has
only
been
accused
innocent
until
proven
guilty
remember
secondly
seem
some
holes
his
accusation
i
read
about
instance
guy
used
particular
van
blow
up
building
go
back
claim
his
deposit
back
afterwards
he
must
incredibly
stupid
perhaps
salamen
one
those
uneducated
muslims
we
hear
so
much
about
nevertheless
he
apparently
smart
enough
put
together
very
sophisticated
bomb
doesn
seem
fit
together
somehow
actually
salameh
only
person
involved
other
fellow
chemical
engineer
working
allied
signal
who
had
specifically
studied
explosive
devices
school
believe
we
actually
allow
radical
muslim
types
study
things
like
our
universities
so
much
price
freedom
from
what
i
read
other
fellow
told
salameh
how
put
together
over
phone
bomb
supposedly
some
sort
sophisticated
type
so
put
i
assume
complicated
sophisticated
bomb
together
from
instructions
over
phone
one
must
need
some
brains
i
would
expect
despite
have
already
been
many
attacks
threats
against
mosques
muslims
united
states
consequence
his
accusation
i
have
read
o
k
now
please
tell
us
where
happening
i
live
u
i
have
heard
very
little
about
mosque
attacks
many
mosques
houston
texas
i
would
like
know
what
going
so
i
can
verify
great
jewish
media
conspiracy
keeping
us
from
knowing
about
u
we
heard
about
mosque
attacks
during
desert
storm
venture
so
why
so
quiet
now
maybe
localized
new
jersey
i
read
article
australian
muslim
times
newspaper
weekly
australian
muslim
community
true
perhaps
one
muslims
based
north
america
see
posting
can
elaborate
islamic
teachings
teach
against
harming
innocent
qur
explicitly
teaches
against
harming
innocents
even
times
war
blowing
up
wtc
harming
innocents
therefore
blatant
contradiction
islamic
teachings
means
absolutely
nothing
plenty
people
commit
violence
while
following
what
think
valid
religious
principles
i
have
seen
people
post
many
things
here
from
koran
which
could
misinterpreted
explanation
you
wish
use
uneducated
muslim
allow
them
harm
idolators
unbelievers
first
thing
every
muslim
says
muslim
could
have
done
because
islam
teaches
against
harming
innocents
we
supposed
take
you
word
never
happens
what
do
you
think
consequence
does
allah
strike
them
down
before
alleged
violence
occurs
course
muslims
commit
violent
act
everyone
hides
behind
verses
koran
we
re
pretty
hip
trick
i
even
doubt
come
up
trials
my
defense
i
am
muslim
islam
teaches
me
harm
innocent
therefore
people
who
were
killed
must
have
been
innocent
sure
we
set
off
bomb
your
honor
you
must
remember
sir
i
am
muslim
allah
all
powerful
allah
would
have
allowed
you
insulting
my
religion
great
defense
eh
just
admit
some
incredibly
stupid
violent
muslims
world
stop
hiding
from
fact
does
one
any
good
deny
only
makes
more
reasonable
muslims
look
like
protecting
bad
ones
can
you
see
i
don
deny
fact
thrust
my
argument
here
salameh
according
us
law
innocent
he
has
been
found
guilty
court
law
his
guilt
has
been
established
wrong
people
make
postings
based
assumption
b
islam
teaches
us
harm
innocents
muslims
who
perhaps
have
realized
islam
teaches
perform
actions
because
teachings
islam
rather
spite
contradiction
teachings
islam
important
distinction
i
should
clarify
what
muslims
usually
mean
when
say
muslim
general
anyone
who
calls
themselves
muslim
does
do
outwardly
profess
something
clear
contradiction
essential
teachings
islam
considered
muslim
thus
one
who
might
do
things
contrary
islam
through
ignorance
example
does
suddenly
become
muslim
one
knowingly
transgresses
islamic
teachings
essential
principles
though
one
does
leave
islam
term
muslim
contrasted
mu
min
which
means
true
believer
however
whether
muslim
reality
mu
min
something
known
only
god
perhaps
person
himself
so
you
find
term
mu
min
used
very
much
muslims
alt
atheism
because
known
anybody
except
myself
god
whether
i
example
am
true
believer
example
i
could
just
putting
show
here
reality
believe
something
opposite
what
i
write
here
without
anyone
knowing
thus
when
we
say
muslims
we
mean
all
those
who
outwardly
profess
follow
islam
whether
practice
might
ignorance
transgress
islamic
teachings
muslim
we
do
necessarily
mean
mu
min
true
believer
islam
