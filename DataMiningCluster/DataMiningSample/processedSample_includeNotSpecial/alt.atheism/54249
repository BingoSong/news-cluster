ninety
hundred
years
ago
everybody
knew
heavier
than
air
machine
could
possibly
fly
would
violate
laws
physics
all
experts

said

example
simon

seems
writer
complete

any
physical

fortunately
few
smart

wright

did
accept
pronouncements
final

now
we
take

crash
today
orthodox

scientists
saying
similar
things
against
several
kinds

technologies
using
negative

pseudo

citing
so
called
laws
which
assert
energy
cannot
created
destroyed
st
law
thermodynamics
always
decrease
useful

physicists
do
know
how
do
certain
things
so
arrogantly
declare
those
things
cannot
done

most

probably
do
create

rather
tap

unlike

devices
need
little
energy
